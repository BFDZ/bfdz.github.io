BBRv1 Congestion ControlThree years have passed since “Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip” (BBR) congestion control was released. Nowadays, it is considered production-ready and added to Linux, FreeBSD, and Chrome (as part of QUIC.) In our blogpost from 2017, “Optimizing web servers for high throughput and low latency,” we evaluated BBRv1 congestion control on our edge network and it showed awesome results: Desktop client’s download bandwidth during BBR experiment in 2017. Since then, BBRv1 has been deployed to Dropbox Edge Network and we got accustomed to some of its downsides. Some of these were eventually fixed, like it being measurably slower for Wi-Fi users. Other tradeoffs were quite conceptual: BBRv1’s unfairness towards loss-based congestion controls (e.g. CUBIC, Compound), RTT-unfairness between BBRv1 flows, and (almost) total disregard for the packet loss: Initial BBRv1 deployment: some boxes have &gt;6% packet loss. BBR developers (and IETF ICCRG) were, of course, also quite aware of these problems and actively worked on solutions. Following issues were identified: Low throughput for Reno/CUBIC flows sharing a bottleneck with bulk BBR flows Loss-agnostic; high packet loss rates if bottleneck &lt; 1.5*BDP ECN-agnostic Low throughput for paths with high degrees of aggregation (e.g. wifi) Throughput variation due to low cwnd in PROBE_RTT Meet BBR version 2BBRv2 aims to solve some major drawbacks of the first version, from lack of concern for packet loss to not giving enough room for new flows to enter. Plus, it also enhances network modeling with aggregation/in-flight parameters and adds experimental support for ECN (explicit congestion notification). CUBIC BBR v1 BBR v2 Model parameters for the state machine N/A Throughput, RTT Throughput, RTT, max aggregation, max inflight Loss Reduce cwnd by 30% on window by any loss N/A Explicit loss rate target ECN RFC3168 (Classic ECN) N/A DCTCP-inspired ECN Startup Slow-start until RTT rises (Hystart) or any loss Slow-start until throughput plateaus Slow-start until throughput plateaus or ECN/Loss rate &gt; target As BBRv2 is getting closer to release, we decided to take it for a spin on Dropbox Edge Network and see how it handles our workloads. But before we get into experimental results (and somewhat pretty pictures), lets cover disclaimers and test setup. DisclaimersNot a low-latency experimentThis experiment was aimed at high-throughput workloads, not latency-sensitive ones. All TCP connections and nginx logs mentioned in the post were filtered by having at least 1Mb of data transferred. Eventually, we may decide on deploying BBRv2 internally in datacenters (possibly even with ECN support) for RPC traffic but that is outside the scope of this post. Not a single connection testThis experiment was performed in a single PoP (point of presence), but on boxes handling millions of connections, so no single connection troubleshooting, tcptrace drill-downs, nor tcpdumps were involved. What follows is a mix of summary statistics, Jupyter notebooks, pandas, and seaborn. Even though seaborn facilitates the creation of pretty graphs, I’ve mostly failed at that, so sorry in advance for the poor graphs’ quality. OTOH, at least it’s not xkcd-style =) This is not a lab testThis is a real-world experiment on our edge network. If you want to test BRRv2 (or any other congestion control) in a lab environment, we would recommend using github.com/google/transperf, that allows “Testing TCP performance over a variety of emulated network scenarios (using netem), including RTT, bottleneck bandwidth, and policed rate that can change over time,” like this: An example of a transperf run. Test setupWe used a set of machines in our Tokyo PoP and tested the following combinations of kernels/congestion control algorithms: 5.3 kernel, cubic 5.3 kernel, bbr1 5.3 kernel, bbr2 4.15 kernel, bbr1 All of the servers are using a combination of mq and sch_fq qdiscs with default settings.Kernel is based on Ubuntu-hwe-edge-5.3.0-18.19_18.04.2 with all the patches from the [v2alpha-2019-11-17](https://github.com/google/bbr/tree/v2alpha-2019-11-17) tag: The set of BBRv2 patches on top of Ubuntu-hwe-edge-5.3.0-18.19_18.04.2 We’ve also applied “tcp: Add TCP_INFO counter for packets received out-of-order” for the ease of merging and “[DBX] net-tcp_bbr: v2: disable spurious warning” to silence the following warning: 1WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 0 at net&#x2F;ipv4&#x2F;tcp_bbr2.c:2426 bbr_set_state [tcp_bbr2] All the graphs in the post were generated from either connection-level information from ss -neit sampling, machine-level stats from /proc, or server-side application-level metrics from web-server logs. Keeping the kernel up-to-dateNewer kernels usually bring quite a bit of improvement to all subsystems including the TCP/IP stack. For example, if we compare 4.15 performance to 5.3, we can see that the latter has ~15% higher throughput, based on the web server logs: 4.15 vs 5.3 median file download throughput from Nginx point of view. Most likely candidates for this improvement are “tcp_bbr: adapt cwnd based on ack aggregation estimation” (that fixed the Wi-Fi slowness mentioned above) and “tcp: switch to Early Departure Time model” (which we’ll talk about later in the AFAP section.) Recent Linux kernels also include mitigations for the newly discovered CPU vulnerabilities. We highly discourage disabling them (esp. on the edge!) so be prepared to take a CPU usage hit. Keeping userspace up-to-dateHaving recent versions of userspace is quite important if you are using newer versions of the kernel compared to what your OS was bundled with. Especially so for packages like ethtool and iproute2. Just compare the output of an ss command with the old version: 12345$ ss -tiets sack bbr rto:220 rtt:16.139&#x2F;10.041 ato:40 mss:1448 cwnd:106ssthresh:52 bytes_acked:9067087 bytes_received:5775 segs_out:6327segs_in:551 send 76.1Mbps lastsnd:14536 lastrcv:15584 lastack:14504pacing_rate 98.5Mbps retrans:0&#x2F;5 rcv_rtt:16.125 rcv_space:14400 …versus the new one: 12345678910$ ss -tiets sack bbr rto:220 rtt:16.139&#x2F;10.041 ato:40 mss:1448 pmtu:1500rcvmss:1269 advmss:1428 cwnd:106 ssthresh:52 bytes_sent:9070462bytes_retrans:3375 bytes_acked:9067087 bytes_received:5775segs_out:6327 segs_in:551 data_segs_out:6315 data_segs_in:12bbr:(bw:99.5Mbps,mrtt:1.912,pacing_gain:1,cwnd_gain:2)send 76.1Mbps lastsnd:9896 lastrcv:10944 lastack:9864pacing_rate 98.5Mbps delivery_rate 27.9Mbps delivered:6316busy:3020ms rwnd_limited:2072ms(68.6%) retrans:0&#x2F;5 dsack_dups:5rcv_rtt:16.125 rcv_space:14400 rcv_ssthresh:65535 minrtt:1.907 As you can see, the new ss version has all the goodies from the kernel’s [struct **tcp_info**](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.3.8/source/include/uapi/linux/tcp.h#L206), plus the internal BBRv2 state from the [struct **tcp_bbr_info**](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.3.8/source/include/uapi/linux/tcp.h#L191). This adds a ton of useful data that we can use even in day-to-day TCP performance troubleshooting, for example, insufficient sender buffer and insufficient receive window/buffer stats from the “tcp: sender chronographs instrumentation” patchset. Experimental resultsLow packet lossFirst things first, immediately after enabling BBRv2 we observe an enormous drop in retransmits. Still not as low as CUBIC, but a great improvement. Also, given that BBR was designed to ignore non-congestion induced packet loss, we can probably say that things work as intended. RetransSegs %, for Cubic, BBRv1, and BBRv2. If we dig deeper and look at ss stats we can see that generally, BBRv2 has way lower packet loss than BBRv1 (note the logarithmic scale) but still way higher than CUBIC: One strange experimental result is that BBRv2 has connections with &gt;60% packet loss, which are present neither on BBRv1 nor CUBIC machines. Looking at some of these connections closer does not reveal any obvious patterns: connections with absurdly large packet loss come from different OS’es (based on Timestamp/ECN support,) connections types (based on MSS,) and locations (based on RTT.) Aside from these outliers, retransmissions are lower across all RTTs: Somehow, hosts using BBRv2 observe a lower degree of reordering, though this may be a side effect of fewer segments in-flight: Throughput From the Traffic team perspective one of our SLIs for edge performance is end-to-end client-reported file download speed. For this test, we’ve been using server-side file download speed as the closest proxy. Here are the results comparing file download speed from the nginx point of view: BBRv2 versus both BBRv1 and CUBIC: Median nginx throughput, 95% ci (for files &gt;1Mb.) P75 nginx throughput, 95% ci (for files &gt;1Mb.) For lower percentiles of connection speeds, BBRv2 has performance is closer to CUBIC and for higher ones it starts getting closer to BBRv1. Connection-level stats confirm that BBRv2 has lower bandwidth than BBRv1, but still higher than CUBIC: So, is BBRv2 slower? It is, at least to some extent. So, what are we getting in return? Based on connection stats, quite a lot actually. We’ve already mentioned lower packet loss (and therefore higher “goodput”), but there is more. Fewer packets in-flightWe’ve observed way fewer “unacked” packets which is a good proxy for bytes in-flight. BBRv2 looks way better than in BBRv1, and even slightly better than CUBIC: Plotting RTT (round-trip time) versus in-flight shows that in BBRv1 case amount of data in-flight tends to be dependent on the RTT, which looks fixed in BBRv2: As one of BBR co-authors, Neal Cardwell, explains: In all of the cases I’ve seen with unfairness due to differing min_rtt values, the dominant factor is simply that with BBRv1 each flow has a cwnd that is basically 2_bw_min_rtt, which tends to try to maintain 1_bw_min_rtt in the bottleneck queue, which quite directly means that flows with higher min_rtt values maintain more packets in the bottleneck queue and therefore get a higher fraction of the bottleneck bandwidth. The most direct way I’m aware of to improve RTT fairness in the BBR framework is to get rid of that excess queue, or ensure that the amount of queue is independent of a flow’s min_rtt estimate. Receive Window Limited connectionsWe also observe that BBRv2 connections spend way less time being “receive window limited” than BBRv1 and CUBIC connections do: I would assume that CUBIC without sch_fq would look even worse than BBRv1. Lower RTTAs a bonus BBRv2 also has a lower RTT than BBRv1, but strangely higher than CUBIC: Correlations between Min RTT and BandwidthIf we construct Min RTT vs Bandwidth graph then vertical bands represent a network distance from user to our Tokyo PoP while horizontal bands represent common Internet speeds: bbr_mrtt vs bbr_bw scatterplot of all BBR flows in the experiment (both BBRv1 and BBRv2.) What’s interesting here is the exponentially decaying relationship between MinRTT and bandwidth for both BBRv1 and BBRv2. This means that there are some cases where bandwidth is artificially limited by RTT. Since this behavior is the same between BBRv1 and BBRv2 we did not dig too much into it. It’s likely though that bandwidth is being artificially limited by the user’s receive window. The 130+ ms RTT band represents cross-Pacific traffic and hence very likely a GSLB failure to properly route users to the closest PoP. We’ll talk about how we are utilizing RUM data to avoid that in the following blog post. CPU Usage ImprovementsPreviously, BBRv1 updated the whole model on each ACK received, which is quite a lot of work given the millions of ACKs that an average server receives. BBRv2 has an even more sophisticated network path model but it also adds a fast path that skips model updates for the application-limited case. This, in theory, should greatly reduce CPU usage on common workloads. ACK fast-path is not the only optimization that was made, feel free to check out the full list of optimizations in the BBR’s IETF ICCRG 106 presentation. In our tests, though, we did not see any measurable difference in CPU usage between BBRv1 and BBRv2, but this is likely due to BBRv2 having quite a lot of debug code enabled (for now:) Idle CPU on BBRv1 vs BBRv2. Pay special attention to the CPU usage if you are testing BBR with ECN enabled since it may render GRO/GSO unusable for high packet loss scenarios. ConclusionsIn our testing BBRv2 showed the following properties: Bandwidth is comparable to CUBIC for users with lower percentiles of Internet speeds. Bandwidth is comparable to BBRv1 for users with higher percentiles of Internet speeds. Packet loss is 4 times lower compared to BBRv1*; still 2x higher than CUBIC. Data in-flight is 3 times lower compared to BBRv1; slightly lower than CUBIC. RTTs are lower compared to BBRv1; still higher than CUBIC. Higher RTT-fairness compared to BBRv1. Overall, BBRv2 is a great improvement over the BBRv1 and indeed seems way closer to being a drop-in replacement for Reno/CUBIC in cases where one needs slightly higher bandwidth. Adding experimental ECN support to that and we can even see a drop-in replacement for Data Center TCP (DCTCP). *Minus the 0.0001% of outliers with a &gt;60% packet loss.

Dropbox has a globally distributed Edge network, terabits of traffic, and millions of requests per second. All of which is managed by a small team in Mountain View, CA. The Traffic team is hiring both SWEs and SREs to work on TCP/IP packet processors and loadbalancers, HTTP/gRPC proxies, and our internal gRPC-based service mesh. Not your thing? Dropbox is also hiring for a wide variety of engineering positions in San Francisco, New York, Seattle, Tel Aviv, and other offices around the world. Appendix A. BBRv2 DevelopmentDevelopment happens on github.com/google/bbr. Discussions are happening on the bbr-dev mailing list. Here is the list of BBR design principles (bold means it’s new v2): Leave headroom: leave space for entering flows to grab React quickly: using loss/ECN, adapt to delivery process now to maintain flow balance Don’t overreact: don’t do a multiplicative decrease on every round trip with loss/ECN Probe deferentially: probe on a time scale to allow coexistence with Reno/CUBIC Probe robustly: try to probe beyond estimated max bw, max volume before we cut est. Avoid overshooting: start probing at an inflight measured to be tolerable Grow scalably: start probing at 1 extra packet; grow exponentially to use free capacity Here are some notable milestones in BBRv2 development to date: BBR v2 algorithm was described at IETF 104: Prague, Mar 2019 [video] [slides] BBR v2 open source release was described at IETF 105: Montreal, July 2019 [video] [slides] BBR v2 performance improvements and fixes IETF 106: Singapore, Nov 2019 [video] [slides] Appendix B. Explicit Congestion NotificationECN is a way for the network bottleneck to notify the sender to slow down before it runs out of buffers and starts “tail dropping” packets. Currently, though, ECN on the Internet is mostly deployed in a so-called “passive” mode. Based on Apple’s data 74+% most popular websites “passively” support ECN. On our Tokyo PoP, we currently observe 3.68% of connections being negotiated with ECN, 88% of which have an ecnseen flag. There are a lot of upsides to using ECN both internally and externally, as described in “The Benefits of Using Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN)” RFC. One of the downsides of Classic ECN (a.k.a RFC3168) is that it is too prescriptive about explicit congestion signal: 123Upon the receipt by an ECN-Capable transport of a single CE packet, the congestion control algorithms followed at the end-systems MUST be essentially the same as the congestion control response to a *single* dropped packet....The indication of congestion should be treated just as a congestion loss in non-ECN-Capable TCP. That is, the TCP source halves the congestion window &quot;cwnd&quot; and reduces the slow start threshold &quot;ssthresh&quot;. (And for a good reason, since any difference in behavior between explicit (CE mark) and implicit (drop) congestion will definitely lead to unfairness.) Other RFCs, like the “Problem Statement and Requirements for Increased Accuracy in Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Feedback,” call out the low granularity of classic ECN that is only able to feedback one congestion signal per RTT. Also for a good reason: DCTCP (and BBRv2) implementation of ECN greatly benefits from its increased accuracy: M. Alizadeh et al. Data Center TCP (DCTCP). DCTCP’s custom interpretation of CE leads to a total unfairness towards classic congestion control algorithms. RFC8311, “Relaxing Restrictions on Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Experimentation” tries to fix this by relaxing this requirement so that implementations are free to choose behavior outside of one specified by Classic ECN. Talking about ECN it’s hard to not mention that there is also a “congestion-notification conflict” going over a single code point (a half a bit) of space in the IP header between the “Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput (L4S)” proposal and the bufferbloat folks behind the “The Some Congestion Experienced ECN Codepoint (SCE)” draft. As Jonathan Corbet summarizes it: These two proposals are clearly incompatible with each other; each places its own interpretation on the ECT(1) value and would be confused by the other. The SCE side argues that its use of that value is fully compatible with existing deployments, while the L4S proposal turns it over to private use by suitably anointed protocols that are not compatible with existing congestion-control algorithms. L4S proponents argue that the dual-queue architecture is necessary to achieve their latency objectives; SCE seems more focused on fixing the endpoints. Time will show which, if any, draft is approved by IETF, in the meantime, we can all help the Internet by deploying AQMs (e.g. fq_codel, cake) to the network bottlenecks under our control. There is an RFC for that too, namely, “IETF Recommendations Regarding Active Queue Management”, that has a whole section on AQMs and ECN. Appendix C. Beyond As Fast As Possible“Evolving from AFAP – Teaching NICs about time”There is a great talk by Van Jacobson about the evolution of computer networks and that sending “as fast as possible” is not an optimal in today’s Internet and even inside a datacenter. You can checkout slides and video of Van Jacobson’s netdev talk. Coverage is available from Julia Evans (@b0rk) and LWN.net (@BPismenny). This talk is a great summary of the reasons why one might consider using pacing on the network layer and a delay-based congestion control algorithm. Fair Queue schedulerQuite often we mention that all our Edge boxes run with Fair Queue scheduler: 12345678910$ tc -s qdisc show dev eth0qdisc mq 1: root Sent 100800259362 bytes 81191255 pkt (dropped 122, overlimits 0 requeues 35) backlog 499933b 124p requeues 35qdisc fq 9cd7: parent 1:17 limit 10000p flow_limit 100p buckets 1024 orphan_mask 1023 quantum 3028 initial_quantum 15140 low_rate_threshold 550Kbit refill_delay 40.0ms Sent 1016286523 bytes 806982 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0) backlog 0b 0p requeues 0 2047 flows (2044 inactive, 0 throttled) 6162 gc, 0 highprio, 43782 throttled, 2716 ns latency... We also mention that our main goal is not the fair queueing itself but pacing introduced by tc-fq. Earlier fq implementations did add some jitter to TCP’s RTT estimations which can be problematic inside the data center since it will likely inflate p99s of RPC requests. This was solved in “tcp: switch to Early Departure Time model.” Here is an example of pacing at work: let’s use [bpftrace](https://github.com/iovisor/bpftrace) to measure difference between packets are enqueued into the qdisc and dequeued from it: 1234567891011121314151617181920# bpftrace qdisc-fq.bt@us:[0] 237486 | |[1] 8712205 |@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ |[2, 4) 21855350 |@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@|[4, 8) 4378933 |@@@@@@@@@@ |[8, 16) 372762 | |[16, 32) 178145 | |[32, 64) 279016 | |[64, 128) 603899 |@ |[128, 256) 1115705 |@@ |[256, 512) 2303138 |@@@@@ |[512, 1K) 2702993 |@@@@@@ |[1K, 2K) 11999127 |@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ |[2K, 4K) 5432353 |@@@@@@@@@@@@ |[4K, 8K) 1823173 |@@@@ |[8K, 16K) 778955 |@ |[16K, 32K) 385202 | |[32K, 64K) 146435 | |[64K, 128K) 31369 | | qdisc-fq.bt is a part of supplementary material to the “BPF Performance Tools: Linux System and Application Observability” book by Brendan Gregg.

一、谷歌分析篇博客目前使用的是谷歌分析（Google Analytics）来跟踪和统计用户访问数据，因为 uBlokc Origin 等反广告插件会屏蔽谷歌分析的域名，所以谷歌分析的数值会有一定偏差，根据我之前使用谷歌分析反向代理服务器的经验，实际统计数据大约比现在看到的数值高 10%。 首先我们来看网站去年的受众群众概览： 去年全年会话数 197271，用户数 127746。在统计图中有三次明显的访问量增高： 2019 年 3 月 7 日网页浏览量达到 2940。分析显示流量主要来自豆瓣，因为豆瓣的猫叔Mack分享了我的一篇博文（2019 年十大热门 BT 站），带来了很多新用户。 2019 年 11 月 15 日网页浏览量达到 1831，用户主要来自搜索引擎以及自然流量。 2019 年 12 月 23 日网页浏览量达到 4293。在 12 月 19 日晚上，年度热剧《庆余年》全集遭泄露，我在 20 日发布的全集下载链接被谷歌放到了搜索结果首页，从而产生访问量激增。 用户地理位置中 78.08% 位于中国，毕竟本站是中文博客。国内会话数前五的城市分别是北京、上海、深圳、广州、成都。 再来看当今互联网上流行的操作系统。Windows 和 Android 占据了 82.27% 的会话数，剩下的会话数苹果家占了 16 %，Linux 只有可怜的 1%，最后居然还有 0.01% 的人在用我的童年记忆——塞班系统。 2019 年共发布了 20 篇文章，截至本文撰写前，博客文章总共 140 篇。2019 年浏览量前五的文章： 绅士站整理 庆余年第一季泄露版全集网盘下载 BT 种子添加有效 tracker 的方法 2019 年十大热门 BT 站 2018 年十大热门 BT 站 二、网站架构篇很长一段时间用的是自己修改过的旧版 material-x 主题，上上个月换了新版 material-x 主题。 最初网站同步部署在 Github Pages 和 Coding Pages 上面，主要访问由 Github Pages 承担。后来 Github Pages 的国内访问速度逐渐变得很慢，主站访问切到了 Coding Pages，然后 2019 年 11 月份 Coding Pages 发生了一次长时间的严重故障，我将网站部署到了三个 vps 上面。当本地有新文章推送到 Github 的博客仓库时，三个不同位置的 vps 会自动拉取更新，同时使用 Perfops 提供的智能 DNS 服务 FlexBalancers，分流全球的用户访问到最近的服务器。 三、工具服务篇本站提供的简介自动生成工具 PT-Gen ，有越来越多的朋友在使用。2019 年用户数 7,262，会话数 21,973。 PT-Gen 的 API 服务器经过几次迁移以及优化，目前能够保持稳定的运行。距离上一次服务重启，已经持续稳定运行了 61 天。 最后祝大家新春快乐！","categories":[{"name":"日志","slug":"日志","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/categories/%E6%97%A5%E5%BF%97/"}],"tags":[{"name":"谷歌分析","slug":"谷歌分析","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/%E8%B0%B7%E6%AD%8C%E5%88%86%E6%9E%90/"},{"name":"年度报告","slug":"年度报告","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E6%8A%A5%E5%91%8A/"}]},{"title":"2020

1、海盗湾网址：https://thepiratebay.org/ 海盗湾建站至今超过 16 年，仍在继续运营。在经历了 2018 年的严重停机事故之后，去年表现相对平稳。该网站几个月前关闭了新用户注册，但仍向公众开放。它仍在使用 .org 域名，但不确定将来是否会如此。 2、YTS.lt网址: https://yts.lt/ 这个网站是原 YTS/YIFY 的非官方继任者。该网站侧重于全球热门的电影发布。YTS 最近成为美国三起诉讼的被告，虽然运营商签署同意了判决，向一名电影制作人支付损害赔偿金，但该网站仍处于在线状态。 3、1337X网址：https://1337x.to/ 1337X 保住了前三的位子，与其他一些网站不同的是，它有一群忠实的 up 主，每天都会提供新种子。 4、RARBG网址：https://rarbg.to/ 在过去的一年里，RARBG 一直保持稳定运营。RARBG 成立于 2008 年，该站在高清电影和电视剧方面更新速度较快。该站有多个域名，这里选取访问量最大的域名进行排名。 5、NYAA.si网址：https://nyaa.si/ NYAA.si 是知名动漫 BT 站 NYAA 关站重生后的网站。虽然有来自其他 BT 站的激烈竞争，但 NYAA 表现良好，与去年排名相比上升了一位。 6、Torrentz2网址：https://torrentz2.eu/ Torrentz2 是 Torrentz.eu 的替代网站，Torrentz.eu 网站于 2016 年自愿关闭。该网站没有存储任何种子文件，但仍然是一个很受欢迎的种子搜索引擎。 7、EZTV.io网址：https://eztv.io/ 最初的电视剧发布组 EZTV 在 2015 年被恶意收购后关站，新所有者声称拥有该品牌。该组织去年改用了一个新域名，由于与海盗湾（Pirate Bay）共用了 IP 地址，因此无意中被荷兰封锁屏蔽。 8、LimeTorrents网址：https://www.limetorrents.info/ LimeTorrents 已经有十多年的历史了。跟这个榜单中的其他网站一样，被世界各地的 ISP 封锁，在一定程度上影响了整体访问流量。 9、Fitgirl Repacks网址：https://fitgirl-repacks.site/ FitGirl Repacks 绝不是一个传统的 BT 站。它是一个游戏发布组的网站，它发布热门游戏的精简破解版，从而将下载时间降至最低。他们在其他网站上发布种子，但也提供他们自己的磁力链接，这就是为什么我们在这里加入这个网站的原因。 10、Tamil Rockers网址：https://tamilrockers.ws/ TamilRockers 在印度非常出名，并设有基地。由于它有英文版本，该网站在全球范围内都有使用。尽管印度发起过几次执法行动，并逮捕了涉嫌的管理员和操作员，但该网站仍在蓬勃发展。","categories":[{"name":"BT","slug":"BT","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/categories/BT/"}],"tags":[{"name":"BT","slug":"BT","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/BT/"},{"name":"torrent","slug":"torrent","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/torrent/"}]},{"title":"bilibili晚会

是最流行的翻墙软件之一。从2019年5月起，大量的中国网民反馈他们的Shadowsocks服务器被封锁了。这篇报告是我们对中国的防火长城（GFW）是如何检测和封锁Shadowsocks及其衍生翻墙软件的初步调查结果。通过网络测量实验，我们发现GFW会被动的监视网络流量从而识别出疑似Shadowsocks的网络流量；然后对对应的Shadowsocks服务器进行主动探测已验证其怀疑的正确与否。Shadowsocks的封锁程度可能受人为因素在政治敏感时期的控制。我们提出一种规避方法，即改变网络数据包在Shadowsocks握手阶段的大小。这种方法被证明可以在现阶段有效减少主动探测。我们会继续与开发者合作让Shadowsocks及其衍生工具变得更加难以封锁。 主要发现 防火长城（GFW）已经启用主动探测的手段来识别Shadowsocks服务器。GFW采用被动监测与主动探测相结合的方式：其首先监测网络连接找出疑似Shadowsocks的连接，然后再把自己伪装成一个客户端，尝试对疑似Shadowsocks的服务器进行连接，从而验证自己的猜测。我们知道GFW可以对多种翻墙工具进行主动探测，现在Shadowsocks也成了其中一员。 主动探测系统可以发送多种不同类型的探测。其中一些探测是基于对之前合法客户端建立的连接的重放；而另一些探测则似乎与之前的合法连接并不相关。 如同之前的研究发现，主动探测来自大量不同的源IP地址。这使得基于源IP来过滤GFW探测包不太可行。亦如之前的研究发现，网络层面的侧通道显示这些来自数以千计的IP地址的主动探测并非完全相互独立，而是源于GFW的集中控制。 很少量的（大于13个）合法连接即足以触发对于Shadowsocks服务器的主动探测。只要合法客户端还在使用服务器，主动探测就会持续下去。GFW通常在合法连接到达服务器后的数秒内发送第一个主动探测。 一旦GFW主动识别出Shadowsocks服务器，GFW可能会丢弃所有发送自服务器IP地址，或服务器Shadowsocks端口的数据包。但GFW也可能不立即采取封锁措施。Shadowsocks的封锁程度可能受人为因素在政治敏感时期的控制。 GFW的被动监测模块至少会根据网络数据包的长度来怀疑可疑流量。改变数据包的长度，比如所在服务端安装brdgrd，即可通过干扰被动监测模块对Shadowsocks流量的识别，进而显著减少主动探测的数量。 我们怎么知道的？我们在境外搭建了自己的Shadowsocks服务器并从中国用客户端连接它们，与此同时，在服务器和客户端两端抓包进行分析。所有的实验都是在2019年7月5号到2019年11月11号之间进行的。其中的绝大部分实验都是在2019年9月16日开始的一次大规模封锁后进行的。 在绝大部分实验中，我们使用了shadowsocks-libev v3.3.1作为客户端和服务端，因为它是一个被积极维护且具有代表性的Shadowsocks实现。我们相信我们所发现的这些弱点在其他Shadowsocks及其衍生工具，如Outline VPN，中同样存在。 若非明确指出，我们未对任何实验中的客户端及服务器的网络功能进行修改，比如更改防火墙的设置。Shadowsocks可以使用不同的加密设置，我们对Stream ciphers和AEAD ciphers都进行了测试。 主动探测的一些细节Shadowsocks是一项加密通讯协议，其数据包的内容被设计得（应）不包含任何固定特征。其两种加密模式都基于一个主密码，两种模式分别为：Stream(不推荐使用) 和 AEAD (推荐)。这两种加密模式虽都要求客户端事先知道主密码；但是Stream加密模式的服务器仅能对客户端进行较弱的验证。除非使用额外的技术手段，两种模式都不能防御对之前发送过的验证数据包的重放攻击。 主动探测的类型及审查者意图我们目前观察到五种不同的主动探测荷载。 基于重放的探测： 重放某一合法连接中第一个携带数据的数据包中的荷载。 重放某一合法连接中第一个携带数据的数据包中的荷载，但更改第0字节。 重放某一合法连接中第一个携带数据的数据包中的荷载，但更改第0–7和第62–63字节。 看似随机的探测（并非基于我们所观察到的合法连接）： 荷载长度为7到50字节，占所有看似随机的主动探测的70%。 荷载长度为221字节，占所有看似随机的主动探测的30%。 我们怀疑GFW的主动探测系统根据服务器对这几种不同类型的主动探测的反馈来判定其是否为Shadowsocks服务器。 Shadowsocks-libev有一个重放过滤器; 但是大多数的Shadowsocks实现则没有。重放过滤器可以防御一模一样的重放（类型1），如果载荷的最初几字节被改变了（类型2和3）那么过滤器就无法防御了。过滤器本身也不够阻止主动探测模块去比较服务器对多种探测的反应。 多少次合法连接就能触发主动探测对主动探测的触发似乎需要达到一定的阀值。比如在一项实验中，仅仅13次连接就足以引起GFW的怀疑并触发主动探测。初步结果显示，使用了AEAD的Shadowsocks，可能需要稍微多一点点的连接才会触发主动探测。 合法连接与主动探测的关系我们让客服端每5分钟对Shadowsocks服务器进行16次连接。虽然我们的服务器触发了大量的主动探测，但不知为何，其并未被GFW封锁。 上图显示在客户端与服务器有通讯的时间里，服务器会收到主动探测。当合法客户端与服务器的通讯停止下来后，大部分的主动探测也停了。值得指出的是，每小时中主动探测的数量并非固定值，与合法客服端的连接数目比也并非1:1。 主动探测的延迟性GFW的主动探测系统可以将合法连接的载荷保存下来，然后延迟一段时间再发起一个新的连接进行重放。下图显示了合法连接与重放攻击之间的延时关系。由于一个合法的载荷可能被多次重放（某一次实验中观察到的最大值为47次），我们呈现两组关系：桔黄色的线代表基于一个合法载荷的第一次重放；蓝色的线代表所有基于重放的探测（不限定为第一次）。 结果显示多于90%的重放攻击发生在合法连接发送后的一小时之内。观察到的最短的延迟仅有0.4秒，而最长延迟竟有大约400小时。 主动探测的源我们在目前所有实验中总计观察到3,5477次主动探测。它们来自1,0547个不同的IP地址，IP地址均属于中国。 源自治系统。主动探测来源占比最多的两个自治系统 AS 4837 (CHINA169-BACKBONE CNCGROUP China169 Backbone,CN) 和 AS 4134 (CHINANET-BACKBONE No.31,Jin-rong Street,CN)，分别为中国联通和中国电信的主干网。这一结果与之前对主动探测的研究一致。 中心化结构。尽管这些主动探测来源于上千个不同的IP地址，有迹象显示它们的行为均受到一小撮进程的集中管控。下图显示了每个主动探测的SYN包所携带的TCP timestamp值。TCP timestamp是一个32位的计数器，其以固定的速度进行增长。其不是一个绝对值，而是一个取决于TCP实现和系统上次重启时间的相对值。下图显示这些来源于上千个独立的IP地址的主动探测，共享着很少量的TCP timestamp序列。在这次实验中，至少观察到9个不同的物理系统或进程，而绝大多数主动探测似乎来源于同一进程。我们说“至少”和“似乎”是因为如果两个或以上的独立进程的截距非常相近，那么我们可能把它们误认为一个进程。序列的斜率显示timestamp的增长速度为250HZ。 如何规避针对Shadowsocks的封锁？GFW对于Shadowsocks的检测需要两步： 第一步，被动监测并识别疑似Shadowsocks的连接。 第二步，主动探测疑似Shadowsocks的服务器。 因此，为避免封锁，我们可以（1）设法避免被监测模块怀疑到，或者（2）让服务器以不被怀疑的方式回应主动探测。我们将展示如何通过安装改变数据包大小的软件来达到目标（1）。 Brdgrd是一款可以被安装在Shadowsocks服务器上，从而导致Shadowsocks客服端发送较小的数据包的软件。它设计之初衷是用来干扰GFW识别Tor节点，因为它迫使GFW在检测之前首先对TCP流进行复杂的重组。但这里我们利用它可以改变从客户端到服务器的数据包大小的功能。改变数据包的大小可以干扰流量识别环节，从而在极大程度上缓解主动探测。 上图显示了一个受到主动探测的Shadowsocks服务器，在开启brdgrd后的数小时内不再收到主动探测。而当我们关闭brdgrd，主动探测立刻继续。我们第二次开启brdgrd，主动探测在之后的40小时里完全停止，但之后又有些许主动探测。 另一组实验显示，在第一次运行Shadowoscks之初就启用brdgrd也许更加的有效。 Brdgrd的原理是将TCP Window Size改写为一个小得罕见的值。因此，审查者可能可以检测出brdgrd被使用了。因此，尽管brdgrd可以在现阶段有效的减少主动探测，其不能被看作是一个一劳永逸的解决方案。 尚未解决的问题尽管我们已经清楚GFW会主动探测Shadowsocks服务器，我们仍不清楚主动探测与Shadowsocks服务器被封之间的关系。我们有33组Shadowsocks服务器分布于世界各地。尽管它们中的大多数都遭受到了大量的主动探测，但是仅有3台服务器被封锁。更有趣的是，其中一台被封锁的服务器只被使用了很短的一段时间，因此受到的主动探测数量应该比很多未被封锁的服务器要少得多。 我们提出3种假设试图解释这一有趣的现象： Shadowsocks服务器的封锁是由人为的因素控制的。也就是说，GFW也许维护了一份在不同程度上被怀疑为Shadowsocks服务器的清单，然后根据人工因素来决定对服务器进行封锁还是解封。这一假设可以解释为什么更多的服务器是在政治敏感时期被封锁的。 另一个假设是GFW的主动探测对于一些我们实验采用的Shadowsocks实现无效。确实，我们被封锁的那3台服务器都是使用了与其他实验中的Shadowsocks不同的实现。如果GFW是根据某些Shadowsocks服务器实现对主动探测的特有反应来识别判断的话，那么这一假设更有可能为真。 第三个假设是对于Shadowsocks的封锁在地理上存在着不一致性。我们被封锁的那3台服务器所在的数据中心不同于其他大多数实验，使用的客服端也是位于一般的居民网络，而非数据中心。如果GFW更注意属于某些数据中心的IP地址，抑或更注意来自一般居民网络的客户端连接，那么这一假设更有可能为真。 致谢我们想在此感谢以下人员对此主题的讨论和研究： Shadowsocks-libev 的开发者们

某大学文学史专业的学生张庆熟读古典名著，但他用现代观念剖析古代文学史的论文命题不被叶教授所认可。为了让叶教授成为自己的研究生导师，张庆决定通过写小说的方式，进一步阐述自己想要表达的观点。在他的小说中，身世神秘的少年——范闲，自小跟随奶奶生活在海边小城澹州，随着一位老师的突然造访，他看似平静的生活开始直面重重的危机与考验。在神秘老师和一位蒙眼守护者的指点下，范闲熟识药性药理，修炼霸道真气并精进武艺，而后接连化解了诸多危局。因对身世之谜的好奇，范闲离开澹州，前赴京都。在京都，范闲凭借过人的智谋与勇武成为年轻一代的佼佼者，他先以诗文冠绝京都，而后出使邻国，营救人质，整合谍报网，查处震动朝野的走私案……这个过程中，范闲饱尝人间冷暖并坚守对正义、良善的坚持，历经家族、江湖、庙堂的种种考验与锤炼，书写了光彩的人生传奇。

v2 + ws + tls 貌似可以应对这种情况。","text":"这几天国际联网线路出现大范围的丢包或干扰，使用 v2 + ws + tls 貌似可以应对这种情况。 1.安装 V2Ray先使用官方脚本安装，以后升级只需重复执行此命令。 1bash &lt;(curl -L -s https://install.direct/go.sh) 新安装完会提示两行，一个端口，一个 uuid，记不记都可以。 官方脚本默认支持 vmess，下一步需要编辑修改 v2 的服务端配置，让支持 ws 和 tls，post 和 id 改成上面的，也可以自己定义，不建议直接搬运下面的，id 相当于密码，还得用你自己的，下面 path 是目录，这里不设。 1nano /etc/v2ray/config.json 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829&#123; \"inbounds\": [ &#123; \"port\": 12345, \"listen\":\"127.0.0.1\", \"protocol\": \"vmess\", \"settings\": &#123; \"clients\": [ &#123; \"id\":

[ &#123; \"protocol\": \"freedom\", \"settings\": &#123;&#125; &#125; ]&#125; 改过配置，就要重启一下 v2 1service v2ray restart 最好也顺手查看下状态，有没有报错 1service v2ray status 2.安装caddy用 caddy 申请证书和反代。这里只勾选 hook.service，hook.service 是 caddy 的自启服务，开机实现自启，你需要其它插件就自己另外加，caddy 是 Go 语言的，以后升级、或者另外加插件，也是一样再一次运行命令即可，会自动替换。 如果服务器之前安装过 nginx ，那么需要将其关闭或卸载，因为 nginx 会占用 80 和 443 端口，和 caddy 产生端口冲突。 1curl https://getcaddy.com | bash -s personal hook.service 然后运行：让自启生效。邮箱换你的，Caddyfile 是 caddy 的默认配置文档，本人习惯和 caddy 同一目录 /usr/local/bin，你要调整就要和下面一并调整 1caddy -service install -agree -email z@z.com -conf /usr/local/bin/Caddyfile 1cd &#x2F;usr&#x2F;local&#x2F;bin 进入 caddy 安装目录，然后 nano Caddyfile 写配置支持 tls 1234567hostloc.xyz &#123; tls z@z.com proxy / 127.0.0.1:12345 &#123; websocket header_upstream -Origin &#125;&#125; 端口要与上面统一，域名用你自己的，二级域名都可以，先做好解析。注意这里是不套 cloudflare 的，你不要开了 cloudflare 的云。 仍然在 /usr/local/bin 当前目录， ./caddy 初次运行一次，会显示申请证书，没报错就是成功了。 需要查看 caddy 运行状态的命令，其它重启、启动就不用说 1caddy -service status 对应的重启、启动、停止就是 caddy -service restart | start | stop 3.客户端设置地址：就是你的域名，端口是 443，ID 是你上面那一串，额外 ID 是 0，传输协议是 ws，其它默认，最下面底层传输安全记得把 tls 选上。完事。 via:

Return a custom request objectasync function handleRequest(request) &#123;return new Response(\"hello world\")&#125; 并提供了相应的CLI工具 Wrangler 进行APP构建。此外，还提供了很简洁的调试界面。 最为良心的Cloudflare Worker是可以免费使用的（免费计划一天最多100,000次请求） 部署基于Cloudflare Worker的Pt-Gen和原项目相比，Pt-Gen-cfworker并不需要你在VPS上搭建复杂（并不）的Python3+uwsgi工具链，只需要你有Cloudflare帐号就可以。 本教程并不介绍Cloudflare帐号的注册方法（请自己搜索），仅分有无Node.js环境对不同用户部署方法进行介绍。 1.无Node环境直接部署因为项目主文件 index.js 加载了两个npm库用于解析页面，所以并不能直接使用。不过在项目的build分支中，我使用Travis CI自动构建了 可以用于CF-Worker的 script.js 。 所以进入Cloudflare的Worker面板，并创建新的Worker。 在Worker代码的编辑器里面，首先修改左上角的Worker名称，这个名称会影响到后面生成的Worker域名（除非你使用已经在CF中注册的其他域名）。然后将 build分支的 script.js 文件全部复制到左侧的代码框中替换Cloudflare默认的代码块。 最后点击Run，如果右侧出现如下图的JSON块说明部署成功。之后你就可以直接使用worker域名进行访问。 如我这边部署的域名是https://ptgen.rhilip.workers.dev/。则获取豆瓣的信息则请求地址如下： https://ptgen.rhilip.workers.dev/?url=https://movie.douban.com/subject/1297880/。请求链接格式和Python写的Pt-Gen相同，既可以使用&amp;url=..... ，也可以使用&amp;site=....&amp;sid=....。且返回字段格式尽可能与原repo相同。 2.Node环境下使用Wrangler部署如果你本地有Node环境，或者希望对Pt-Gen-cfworker有改进的需要，你可以自己构建Worker文件。 Wrangler 文档： https://github.com/cloudflare/wrangler 安装Wrangler并注册全局信息12npm i @cloudflare/wrangler -gwrangler config \"$&#123;CF_EMAIL&#125;\" \"$&#123;CF_API_KEY&#125;\" 其中 ${CF_EMAIL}为你的Cloudflare帐号，而 ${CF_API_KEY} 你可以在你帐号的Profile页面中找到Global API Key。 取得项目源代码并配置Wrangler信息1234git clone https://github.com/Rhilip/pt-gen-cfworker.gitcp wrangler.toml.sample wrangler.tomlsed -i \"s/CF_ACCOUNT_ID/$&#123;CF_ACCOUNT_ID&#125;/g\" wrangler.tomlnpm install 使用git clone或者zip包下载项目源代码后，需要编辑wrangler.toml文件的相关键值，并将account_id值改成你在Worker界面右侧API栏中看到的值，name 值会影响到部署时的值，默认为ptgen。如果你不愿部署在..workers.dev域名下，你可以再参照Wrangler文档，添加zone_id，route等信息，本处不再累述。 部署到workers.dev上123#wrangler build # 构造#wrangler preview # 构造并预览wrangler publish # 构造并发布 如果配置好wrangler信息并使用 wrangler publish，会直接部署，并 提示如下信息 1234567$ wrangler publish⬇️ Installing wasm-pack...⬇️ Installing wranglerjs...Built successfully.Successfully published your script.Successfully made your script available at ptgen.rhilip.workers.dev✨ Success! Your worker was successfully published. ✨ 而如果使用wrangler preview则会在构建完后，弹出https://cloudflareworkers.com/开头的网页。此时你可以使用console等方法对脚本进行调试。 除了使用wrangler，本人还在package.json中设置了alias，你也可以使用 npm {build,preview,publish} （在IDE中）快速调用。 Travis-CI 自动构建本项目使用Travis-CI对主分支的更新进行自动构建生成build分支信息。 相关配置文件写在 .travis.yml 中。请自行查阅，并在Travis-CI中对以下环境变量进行设置： 著作权归作者所有。商业转载请联系作者获得授权，非商业转载请注明出处。作者：Rhilip链接：https://blog.rhilip.info/archives/1095/来源：https://blog.rhilip.info/","categories":[{"name":"PT","slug":"PT","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/categories/PT/"}],"tags":[{"name":"pt","slug":"pt","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/pt/"},{"name":"Cloudflare Worker","slug":"Cloudflare-Worker","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/Cloudflare-Worker/"},{"name":"转载","slug":"转载","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/%E8%BD%AC%E8%BD%BD/"}]},{"title":"PbootCMS 部署教程","slug":"127","date":"2019-07-23T23:08:00.000Z","updated":"2019-07-23T18:02:26.990Z","comments":true,"path":"2019/07/24/127/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/2019/07/24/127/","excerpt":"演示环境 系统: Linux 面板：lnmp nginx php-7.2","text":"演示环境 系统: Linux 面板：lnmp nginx php-7.2 创建网站1lnmp vhost add 因为 PbootCMS 要求开启环境的 Pathinfo 模式支持，所以 Enable PHP Pathinfo 这一项必须选 y ，其他选项随意。 下载和配置进入网站目录 1cd /home/wwwroot/demo.example.com/ 下载 1wget https://github.com/hnaoyun/PbootCMS/archive/V1.4.2.tar.gz 解压 12tar xzvf V1.4.2.tar.gz mv PbootCMS-1.4.2&#x2F;* .&#x2F;

系统必须加载一下模块: php-xml php-dom MySQL 5.x 本文的演示环境： lnmp 1.5 vps Debian 7 1 CPU 512 MB 内存 20G 硬盘 linux 服务器上推荐使用 lnmp 安装环境。如果只是用来做音乐服务器，对 vps 的配置要求不高，因为音乐文件的体积也不大，码率要求也低。 下载安装完 lnmp ，然后创建网站目录 1lnmp vhost list 下载程序，注意不要 git clone ，要从 Release 下载最新版本完整程序安装包。 123cd &#x2F;home&#x2F;wwwroot&#x2F;test.nas.ink&#x2F;wget https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;ampache&#x2F;ampache&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;3.9.0&#x2F;ampache-3.9.0_all.zipunzip ampache-3.9.0_all.zip 修改 config 目录权限，确保安装时配置文件可写入。 1chmod 777 -R config&#x2F; 安装选择语言访问你配置的网站域名，如果没出错，会出现这个安装页面。 Ampache 支持包括中文在内的多种语言。 环境检测PHP 整型大小一项会有警告，但貌似影响可以忽略不计。如果其他项没问题，点击继续。 数据库配置填写端口和密码，然后点击插入数据库。 生成配置文件如果程序安装包解压在网站根目录，web 路径留空，不用填。 填写 MySQL 用户名和密码 其他设置都保存默认即可，除非你清楚选项的作用。 点击查看文件栏，然后点击第一行配置文件后面的写。如果提示写入错误，请检查 config 目录权限。 配置管理员用户名和密码 检查更新 目前是最新版，无需更新。 安装完成现在已经安装成功，返回网站首页即可使用了。 使用说明创建目录目录就是服务器上存储音乐文件的路径，设置目录后 Ampache 可以扫描路径下的音乐文件，将歌曲信息添加到程序的曲库里。 首先在服务器上创建一个目录，用于存放音乐文件。 1mkdir &#x2F;home&#x2F;wwwroot&#x2F;test.nas.ink&#x2F;music 使用 ftp 上传文件到目录。因为 linux 系统没装中文语言，上传后文件名会乱码，所以我都是把文件压缩后上传，再解压。 登录 ampache 后台，第一次进入会提示创建目录。 或者点左侧管理员图标，也可添加目录。 目录名称随意填写，目录类型选 local 。文件名样式按照你上传的音乐文件样式修改，需和你上传的音乐文件名样式对应，右边有参数说明。目录样式按实际情况修改。路径填写你之前创建的目录，注意是绝对路径。然后点击添加目录。 扫描目录第一次添加目录会自动扫描一次，以后上传了新歌可以在目录列表里手动扫描。 扫描完以后，在歌曲标题里面，点击播放按钮可通过网页播放歌曲。 流式播放ampache 的网页播放十分简陋，并且不知什么原因 flac 格式无法播放。ampache 能够覆盖全平台的方式是网络串流。 点击网页右侧的播放方式选项，默认选项：网络播放器，即通过网页播放。现在改成 流。 然后再点击歌曲的播放按钮，就不会再网页播放，而是会提示下载一个 m3u 文件。接触过直播源或者在线视频抓取的同学应该知道 m3u8 这种文件，m3u 是一种 Windows-1252格式纯文本文件，可以指定一个或多个多媒体文件的位置，而 M3U8 就是 UTF-8 编码的 M3U。 下载后，即可使用本地支持 m3u 的播放器打开。列如 VLC、foobar2000。 foobar2000 打开，需要播放过一次才会显示歌曲名等信息，不知道是不是我的版本有问题。所以还是建议用 VLC 播放，VLC 在几乎所有平台是都有对应安装包。 播放列表如果想把全部歌曲生成 m3u 添加到本地播放器曲库，可以通过创建智能播放列表的方式，将全部歌曲生成一个 m3u 文件。 不用添加任何规则，点击创建就是把所以歌曲保存成列表。 然后点播放按钮下载 m3u 文件。 把 m3u 文件拖入 VLC 的媒体库，点击展开列表。 key 的有效期程序默认设置 key 的有效期是 7 个小时，也就是添加到本地播放器媒体库的歌曲 7 个小时后会无法播放。 在管理员，System，将 分享链接的默认有效期改成 0 ，本地的 m3u 歌曲列表就不会失效了。 如果再要使其失效，可以手动刷新 API key 结语Ampache 还有很多功能我没搞清楚怎么用，目前唯一知道的是采用流媒体方式播放，MPDroid 没搞明白怎么配置。在安卓上有个应用叫 Power Ampache ，可以访问 Ampache 服务器，但是使用体验十分差。Plex 做的不错，但移动端是收费的。找了一圈发现还是 VLC 最强大。","categories":[{"name":"Linux","slug":"Linux","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/categories/Linux/"}],"tags":[{"name":"linux","slug":"linux","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/linux/"},{"name":"音乐","slug":"音乐","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/%E9%9F%B3%E4%B9%90/"},{"name":"Ampache","slug":"Ampache","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/Ampache/"}]},{"title":"2019

5、Torrentz2网址：https://torrentz2.eu/ Torrentz2 是 Torrentz.eu 的仿站，虽然去年发生过一些问题，但该站仍然很热门。 6、NYAA.SI网址：https://nyaa.si/ NYAA.si 是之前关站重生后的网站。该站去年被 Cloudflare 停过机，但很快切换了服务商。 7、LIMETORRENTS网址：https://www.limetorrents.info/ Limetorrents 是一个建站时间超过五年的 BT 站。该站几个月前换了域名，并加入了 CDN 以应对各种拦截。 8、ZOOQLE网址：https://zooqle.com/ Zooqle 拥有近 380 万个种子，排名一直保持在前 10。该站官方宣传自己是 Bitsnoop 的替代网站。 9、EZTV.AG网址：http://eztv.ag/ 网站内容主要是英美剧资源。域名换了很多次，目前网站运营团队不知是不是原来的。几个月前，发布组 ETTV 指责该站盗取他们的种子改名发布。 10、TORRENTDOWNLOADS网址：https://www.torrentdownloads.me/ TorrentDownloads 已经建站多年，去年缺席前 10 以后，今年凭借每月数百万的用户访问量回到了榜单。 via:Top 10 Most Popular Torrent Sites of

压制任务申请流程 所有的压制都会在 https://tp.m-team.cc/todo.php 发布压制任务，Internal成员可以前往认领任务。 Internal成员不建议一次认领多个任务（但不包括同一电影的不同分辨率）。 认领首发电影压制需要尽可能快发布，非首发电影建议2周内发布。 管理人员保留对超过限定压制时间的任务重新指派压制人的权利。 格式所有的视频、音频、字幕流等都必须封装在mkv中 视频流所有的压制都建议使用最佳的源进行制作，这意味着可能需要下载多个源进行截图对比。使用更好的源制作的压制可能会代替掉旧的、基于更差的源制作的作品。建议在职人论坛（https://tp.m-team.cc/forums.php?action=viewforum&amp;forumid=11 ）展示你做的对比，以便其他成员观看和评论。 x264是暂时唯一推荐的视频编码。对于x265的补充规定会另外叙述。其余编码因为编码效率和质量等问题不应再采用。对于源视频中存在的问题，鼓励进行修复，但不强制规定。同时，Source vs Encode对比截图也是必须添加到种子详情描述中的，使用滤镜修复的问题区域必须添加Source vs Filtered vs Encode对比截图。 对于10bit压制，推荐添加Source vs 10Bit Encode vs 8Bit Encode截图证明10bit的必要性。 音频流对于压制，不推荐使用体积过大的无损音轨（占总mkv文件体积超过1/3）。 允许的格式 (无损格式): DTS:X / DTS-HD MA. Atmos / TrueHD. 通常杜比Atmos/TrueHD由于旧设备兼容性问题，都会内嵌AC3内核，推荐一并封装至mkv中。 FLAC. 对于单声道/立体声必须使用FLAC，以及源音频格式为LPCM格式必须转换成FLAC格式。 允许的格式 (有损格式): DTS (and other lossy variants). 推荐直接使用DTS-HD/DTS:X中的DTS核心。请务必注意768Kbps的DTS核心不应该使用在压制中，原因是DTS核心的低效编码使得其效果反而不如AC3 640Kbps。如有需要可以使用DTS-HD Master Suite对8声道的DTS-HD/DTS:X音轨进行重新制作，提取DTS-ES 6.1核心。 Dolby Digital (and other lossy variants). 一般直接从Atmos/TrueHD中提取，如果需要压制，可以使用Sony Sound Forge Pro制作，它是Dolby官方授权的编码器。 AAC. 只允许出现在单声道/立体声中，一般使用在导评音轨上。如果是视频主音轨，推荐使用FDK AAC制作，如果是导评音轨，可以使用QAAC制作。 特殊的不允许使用的格式: LPCM. 无论任何情况都不应该出现极为低效的LPCM格式。必须转码至无损的FLAC格式（单声道/立体声）或者使用DTS-HD Master Suite制作成DTS-HD MA格式（多声道）。 导评音轨如果在源上存在，必须进行封装。可以选择直接封装或者进行压制再封装。对于压制，推荐立体声的导评成品码率控制在80Kbps左右。 字幕必须封装源中带有的英文字幕以及中文字幕（如果存在）。并且，必须在mkvtoolnix中正确标注字幕类型。 对于英文字幕，主要存在SDH、Non-SDH、Forced三种类型。SDH全称为Subtitles for the deaf or hard-of-hearing，即听力障碍专用字幕，明显特征为存在很多非对白的描述性字幕。Non-SDH则为普通常见的英语字幕。Forced为非英语对白字幕，即英语电影中只针对外语部分的字幕。 对于英文字幕，封装OCR的.SRT格式也是必须的。鉴于大部分压制员的母语为中文而非英语，OCR可以交由其他人完成。一般在国外站点论坛均有很多母语为英语的用户，并且可以提供OCR处理，详细事宜清联系TnP组组长Nginx。 对于中文字幕，主要需要标注简体、繁体、粤语，对应Simplified、Traditional、Cantonese。中文字幕由于其识别难度大，校对成本高，不推荐每一片都进行中文的OCR处理，热门电影也可以寻求WEBDL片源自带中字进行匹配。 评论音轨字幕需要注明为评论字幕。 章节源中如果存在章节，必须一并封装。如果有具体章节名（非1、2、3…等，存在具体含义的章节名），推荐合理命名。 章节名为英文，必须参照源菜单手动录入。 章节名为非英文，推荐按照Chapter X (原外文章节名)命名。如果录入外文章节名有困难可以只提供Chapter X形式命名。 不存在具体章节名，统一使用ChapterGrabber软件生成命名Chapter X。 文件信息针对各种类型的作品发布前需要注意填写的信息。 压制音视频流的Title填入相关信息。 视频流可以填入”压制人ID @ TnP”以及视频轨道对应信息。 音频流可以填入特殊音轨说明，如导评音轨应填写”Commentary with director Christopher Nolan”。 具体每条轨道的编码格式等信息，必须填写。 举例 EncoderID @ TnP / x264 / 16888 kbps / 1080p / 23.976 fps / 16:9 / High Profile 4.1 DTS-HD Master Audio / 5.1 / 48 kHz / 3826 kbps / 24-bit Commentary with director Christopher Nolan / Dolby Digital Audio / 2.0 / 48 kHz / 224 kbps / 16-bit FLAC Audio / 1.0 / 48 kHz / 579 kbps / 24-bit 默认轨道对于语言为英语的电影： 默认轨道应设置在：视频轨道、第一音频轨道、英文Forced字幕轨道（如有） 非默认轨道应该设置在：除以上的所有轨道 对于语言为非英语的电影： 默认轨道应该设置在：视频轨道、第一音频轨道、第一英文字幕轨道 非默认轨道应该设置在：除以上所有轨道 错误设置默认轨道选项会导致REPACK/PROPER 命名 使用英文命名，以IMDB标题为准。如果电影标题为非英语标题，使用IMDB的”World-wide”标题。如红海行动标题为Operation Red Sea （https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6878882/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_dt_2 ）。 作品题目中需要包含特定的版本信息和片源地区（不填则为默认US或首发片源，推荐存在不同地区片源的时候填写），如加长版（Extended Cut）和日版（JPN） 电影命名压制: Title.Year.Edition.Source.Resolution.Acodec.Vcodec-Tag 举例: Captain.America.The.Winter.Soldier.2014.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-TnP X-Men.Days.of.Future.Past.2014.Hybrid.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-TnP Interstellar.2014.JPN.1080p.BluRay.DTS-HD.MA.5.1.x264-TnP Maze.Runner.2014.REPACK.BluRay.720p.DD5.1.x264-TnP Zootopia.2014.GER.Extended.Cut.BluRay.1080p.Atmos.7.1.x264-TnP 以下是命名中可能用到的编码格式以及对应缩写供参考。 种子详情种子详情需要包含NFO，务必提供恰当的截图进行展示。NFO需要包括： 压制源信息，尽可能涵盖地区、版本、来源小组。一般源文件名即可满足要求。 视频信息、音频信息。主要为分辨率、帧率、编码方式和码率等。 字幕信息。主要为字幕语言。 x264输出日志信息，一般包括”x264 [info]: frame “、”x264 [info]: consecutive B-frames”等。 章节信息。是否包含章节（Yes/No）、章节是否命名（Numbered/Named）。NFO模板小组统一，详细模板查看本版对应主题帖。 恰当的截图包括： Source vs Encode对比截图，Encode必须选取压缩程度最大的B帧，推荐Source选取P帧。 截图使用AVS脚本在恰当位置显示帧信息，包括当前帧数/总帧数、帧类型等。 可能的情况下添加与0day及其他P2P小组的对比截图。如”Source vs Encode vs VietHD vs SPARKS”。 作品发布后的问题REPACK/PROPER作品发布后，主要有以下情况需要进行REPACK/PROPER 对已经发布过的、存在严重问题（如切边有误、花屏、封装有误、音视频流播放有问题等）的作品进行修复，必须进行REPACK/PROPER。重新制作的作品需要在标题中Edition位置注明REPACK（由原发布者自行重新制作）或PROPER（由其他成员制作），并且需要在种子详情明显位置注明修正的问题。 对已经发布过的作品，发布后寻找到新的质量更好（视频、音频）的源，推荐进行REPACK/PROPER，并且需要给出不同源的对比截图。 所有的REPACK/PROPER都会导致原来的作品被删除，新的作品进行置顶和Free处理。 转载来源:TnP压制组标准&amp;规范 / TnP Rules and Standards （11/9更新

加了一层代理，优化加载速度同时防止被屏蔽。 GitHub Repo （求 Star🌚 序目前关于 Google Analytics 大致有两种方案，一种是本文使用介绍的，另一种是利用 Nginx 的 post_action。 前者需要多一次 HTTP 请求，后者有点麻烦，还要过滤搜索引擎 UA，不适用于使用 CDN 的网站。 本文所采用的方案是基于 Google Analytics 异步请求（服务端请求） 提供的代码修改的 Go 版本。 使用方法1. 使用我提供的服务将下面的代码加到你的网站的任意位置，同时修改 &quot;UA-xxxx-x&quot; 为你自己的跟踪代码。 123&lt;script&gt;!function(a,b,c,d,e)&#123;var f=c.screen,g=encodeURIComponent,h=[\"ga=\"+a,\"dt=\"+g(d.title),\"dr=\"+g(d.referrer),\"ul=\"+(e.language||e.browserLanguage||e.userLanguage),\"sd=\"+f.colorDepth+\"-bit\",\"sr=\"+f.width+\"x\"+f.height,\"vp=\"+Math.max(d.documentElement.clientWidth,c.innerWidth||0)+\"x\"+Math.max(d.documentElement.clientHeight,c.innerHeight||0),\"z=\"+ +new Date];c.__ga_img=new Image,c.__ga_img.src=b+\"?\"+h.join(\"&amp;\")&#125;(\"UA-xxxx-x\",\"https://ga.giuem.com\",window,document,navigator,location);&lt;/script&gt; 目前已经部署海外线路（由 CloudFlare 提供），国内为腾讯云上海机房 2. 自己部署服务 安装 你可以选择自己 编译 或者从 release 下载我编译好的二进制文件。 运行 ./ga_proxy [arguments] -d, -debug 输出调试信息-s, -skip_ssl 跳过 SSL 验证-l, -listen 监听地址 要使用后台运行，你可以借助 nohup 或 screen 或 Docker。 添加 JavaScript 代码 把上面的那段代码里的 &quot;https://ga.giuem.com&quot; 改成你自己的地址就行了。 使用效果整个请求花费 33 ms, 156 B 流量可以说是非常快了。服务器的 Ping 值在 29 ms 左右，中间 4 ms 的损失主要花在 SSL 上了，速度还是挺不错的。 相比之下，原生的请求先加载了一个 12.3 KB 大小的 JS 文件，然后才发送统计，总耗时 300 ms，emmmmm 我就不作过多评价了。

should be enabled with the –with-http_realip_module configuration parameter. 原来如此嘛，是当初安装的时候没有安装所需要的模块呀~ 那就开始在已经配置好的nginx上添加未编译安装模块吧。 使用 lnmp.org 提供的一件包可以编辑lnmp.conf文件，添加nginx编译属性，然后使用upgrade.sh来无人值守升级避免下述问题。 1、看下编译安装nginx的时候，都编译安装的哪些模块。执行命令：/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -V，得到一下信息 123456[root@WiseImpressionable-VM src]# /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -Vnginx version: nginx/1.10.0built by gcc 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-17) (GCC)built with OpenSSL 1.0.1e-fips 11 Feb 2013TLS SNI support enabledconfigure arguments:

2、进入到nginx的安装目录，（这里吐槽下Virmach，果真是垃圾VPS提供商。母鸡的IPv6服务坏了快一个月都没能好）。我这里用的是当初我安装lnmp时候留下来的安装包。如果没有的话，可以用wget的方法从nginx官网上重新得到安装包。 123cd /root/lnmp1.3-full/srctar -xf nginx-1.10.0.tar.gzcd nginx-1.10.0 3、重新./configure ，添加所需要的模块后使用make编译。格式应该是这样的：”./configure “ + 第一步得到的configure arguments信息 + 你想要添加的模块。 12[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# ./configure --user=www --group=www --prefix=/usr/local/nginx --with-http_stub_status_module --with-http_ssl_module --with-http_v2_module --with-http_gzip_static_module --with-ipv6 --with-http_sub_module --with-http_realip_module[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# make 千万要注意：到这里就可以了，千万不要make install，不然文件就会被覆盖了。 4、备份原先配置，杀掉nginx进程，然后替换nginx二进制文件 123456[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# cp /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx.bak[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# killall nginx[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# killall nginxnginx: no process killed[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# cp ./objs/nginx /usr/local/nginx/sbin/cp: overwrite `/usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx'? yes 5、更改站点的nginx配置文件，在location / {} 中加入第一篇文章中提到的信息 123456789101112131415161718192021222324252627location / &#123;set_real_ip_from 103.21.244.0/22;set_real_ip_from 103.22.200.0/22;set_real_ip_from 103.31.4.0/22;set_real_ip_from

2a06:98c0::/29;# use any of the following tworeal_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP;#real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;&#125; 6、重启nginx服务 1lnmp nginx restart 我这里用的是lnmp带的命令，你还可以使用下面的命令来重启并检查nginx运行情况 123[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx[root@WiseImpressionable-VM nginx-1.10.0]# netstat -anpt | grep nginxtcp 0 0 0.0.0.0:80 0.0.0.0:* LISTEN 23371/nginx 2018.01.01 更 7、自动更新 cloudflare-real-ip 清单如果你是使用lnmp.org提供的一键包来安装的，请参照进行。 在nginx配置目录创建cloudflare_ip.conf文件touch /usr/local/nginx/conf/cloudflare_ip.conf 修改原有的vhost配置，将原来第五步配置的信息改为include cloudflare_ip.conf; 创建自更新脚本update_cloudflare_ip.sh（假定该文件放在 /root 目录下），内容如下： 123456789101112#!/bin/bashecho \"#Cloudflare\" &gt; /usr/local/nginx/conf/cloudflare_ip.conf;for i in `curl https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v4`; doecho \"set_real_ip_from $i;\" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/nginx/conf/cloudflare_ip.conf;donefor i in `curl https://www.cloudflare.com/ips-v6`; doecho \"set_real_ip_from $i;\" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/nginx/conf/cloudflare_ip.conf;doneecho \"\" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/nginx/conf/cloudflare_ip.conf;echo \"# use any of the following two\" &gt;&gt; /usr/local/nginx/conf/cloudflare_ip.conf;echo

然而，伴随着这项计划的是非常高的成本。数以千计的房屋被推倒，50万居民（占大同市总人口的百分之三十）将在他的打理下被重新安置。这位市长成功与否，完全取决于他是否能让愤怒的工人群体以及越来越忐忑的统治精英冷静下来。纪录片《中国市长》惊人地捕捉到了一个男人，甚至是一个国家疯狂跳跃着进入一个越来越动荡的未来的过程。 BT种子

中国早已经是世界第二大经济体，但政府还是不得不承认自己是一个人口众多的发展中国家。随着城市化和工业化进程的加快，中国社会保障体系的建设远远落后于经济发展速度的矛盾日益呈现。 在急诊室，表面上离奇、荒诞的故事一一在镜头前“上演”。一方面，我们看到很多不懂得爱惜自己生命的人，另一方面，我们也表现出对一个健全有效的医疗保障体系渴望。 两千多年前，中国的哲人孟子已经提出，理想的“大同”社会应该是“老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼”。近年，中国政府大张其鼓倡导的“和谐”社会似乎就是来源于此。社会理想的状况应该是让每个人都能有尊严活着，然后有尊严地死去。 最后，我们要特别感谢那些允许我们拍摄普通的中国人，成片时我们没法一一再联系到他们，并征求得他们的同意。是他们的故事让我们更加了解我们生存的社会，本片也将承诺不进行任何商业运作。

中国的一粒棉花籽最后如何成为美国零售店里的有一条牛仔裤？在这个过程里究竟有多少耐人寻味的故事？本片将跟随那些被紧紧捆绑在绵延5000公里长的棉纺产业链上的人们，以棉花为线索，讲述他们的故事、描述中国人完成“中国制造”的整个接力过程。 《棉花》前所未有地揭示了当代中国农民、企业工人、纺织品商人……也就是工贸链条上形形色色人群之间不同生活的内在联系。他们虽然生活在不同的地方，做着不同的工作，但都被紧紧捆绑在棉花的产业链上：这些棉花和被制成的衣服，将生活状态截然不同的人们联结到一起，本片通过深入直接的采访记录他们的日常生活，思索不同人们共同面对的生活命题, 展示中国经济各环节的真正面貌。 ◎获奖情况 第51届台北金马影展

Hao Zhou ◎简 介 本片纪录了中国福建省一所普通中学一个高三毕业班的真实生活。高三的生活日复一日，简单而又沉重，痛苦却也快乐。 善良严厉的班主任，紧张刻苦的尖子生，逃避生活的“差生”，执着爱情的“早恋生”，学生的父母，每个亲历高三的人都有各自的感悟和超越高三的期望。影片的纪录真实、直白，透过高三生活的纪录，让人感到的不仅仅是为理想执着拼搏的浪漫，更有一种如鲠在喉的悲哀。 下载链接

45公里，香港80公里。20世纪80年代初至今，来自台湾、香港的资本和中国内地的大量廉价劳动力使它从农业小镇迅速发展为一个劳动密集型的工业城镇。工厂里的工人是进城打工的农民，他们从中国内地最贫困地区来到广东的厚街镇。工厂附近的出租屋是农民们进入城市的第一个落脚点，也是他们远离故乡后在千里之处建起的另一个家。本片真实记录了这些在厚街打工农民鲜为人知的生活状况，它们成为中国城市化进程中不可忽视的重要组成部分。

3、付款进入后台：https://cp.tsukaeru.ne.jp/ 选择自己的VPS，如果买了多个的话。 进入付款页面。 二、tsukaeru VPS的管理1、如图即可。 下图就是放行所有端口（tcp和udp） via:tsukaeru日本100M不限流量KVM

/usr/local/nginx/conf/fastcgi.conf 文件 fastcgi_param PHP_ADMIN_VALUE &quot;open_basedir=$document_root/:/tmp/:/proc/&quot;;，个人感觉这个设计有点别扭，这个配置对所有站点都写死了不灵活。 对于详细错误的解释：由于我们在站点配置文件（/usr/local/nginx/conf/vhost/{WEB_SITE}.conf），网站根目录配置 root /home/wwwroot/{WEB_SITE_NAME}; 这一行进行修改（修改成了 root /home/wwwroot/{WEB_SITE_NAME}\\public; ），因此 open_basedir=$document_root/... 中 $document_root 指的是网站的 public 目录，而非 /home/wwwroot/{WEB_SITE_NAME}，在读取 bootstrap.php 文件（而该文件正好位于 /home/wwwroot/{WEB_SITE_NAME} 目录下，在 public 目录上一层）时出错，受跨目录访问安全限制。 主要有两种解决方案： 直接注释掉 fastcgi.conf 文件中的 fastcgi_param PHP_ADMIN_VALUE &quot;open_basedir=$document_root/:/tmp/:/proc/&quot;; 这一行，一棒子打死了目录访问安全策略 在 fastcgi.conf 文件中，修改 fastcgi_param PHP_ADMIN_VALUE &quot;open_basedir=$document_root/:/tmp/:/proc/&quot;; ，以 test.com 为例（此域名为添加vhost时输入的域名），修改内容如下：（这样做的坏处时每次添加vhost时都需要手动添加⊙﹏⊙） 12/usr/local/nginx/conf/fastcgi.conffastcgi_param PHP_ADMIN_VALUE

shell 命令。 这个漏洞比 uTorrent 和 Transmission 的更严重，因为不用像 uTorrent 那样必须和用户产生交互。 XML-RPC 的配置有两种常见的方法: TCP sockets 和 UNIX sockets 1. TCP sockets：12httpd.conf: SCGIMount &#x2F;RPC2 127.0.0.1:5000rtorrent.rc: scgi_port &#x3D; localhost:5000 TCP sockets 方式在 Nginx 的配置：12345location &#x2F;RPC2 &#123; scgi_pass 127.0.0.1:5000; include scgi_vars; scgi_var SCRIPT_NAME &#x2F;RPC2;&#125; 2.

其实在很早以前 rtorrent 官网的配置说明中就不推荐使用 TCP sockets 的方法，在 rtorrent 的 wiki 和 archlinux 的 wiki 也都注明了漏洞的相关警告。 但是目前网上还有很多教程在配置 Nginx 时使用的是 TCP sockets。如果你是按照网络教程安装的 rtorrent ，可检查 Nginx 或其他web服务程序的配置文件，以及观察服务器 CPU 使用率是否异常。 如果你需要把 Nginx 的 RPC 配置改成 UNIX sockets 方式，可以参考这篇文章：rTorrent + ruTorrent 安装和配置 还有一部分人可能用的是 github 上面的一键脚本 arakasi72/rtinst，这个脚本默认使用 rutorrent 的 RPC Plugin 来和 rtorrent 通信，并且启用了 Nginx 的登录验证，目前不会受到此漏洞影响。 参考资料： Hackers exploiting rTorrent to install Unix coin miner have netted $4k so far PluginRPC Using XMLRPC with rtorrent RPC-Setup-XMLRPC - rtorrent wiki RuTorrent - archlinux

1、没有单种1t以上的情况，可以从ut3.x版本降级到ut2.2.1或更低版本 具体操作办法也相对简单，下载得到旧版ut后将主程序直接替换即可。相关任务、设置等均可继承。低版本ut下载地址: http://www.oldversion.com/windows/utorrent/ 2、迁移至qb，适用单种1t以上的情况 qBittorrent 是开源软件，简洁易用无广告，而且跨平台 Linux, Mac OS X, Windows都能用。选项-高级中可以关闭更新检测，不会像 UT 强制更新，而且跟 deluge 相同内核，性能强劲。 qBittorrent 我选择的是3.3.11，支持馒头 其他版本我没实验过，自行验证。可以在sourceforge上下到这个版本，sourceforge 的可信度请自行考证。 qBittorrent 论坛有人写了个小工具，可以简单快速的将种子从 uTorrent 迁移到 qBittorrent 。首先当然是暂停 uTorrent 中的所有种子，确认全停了之后，然后退出uTorrent，qB 也要关闭。 下载ut2gt.exe（地址在下面），然后打开CMD，先将程序拖到命令行窗口。会自动填写路径 例： C:\\Users\\你的用户名\\Desktop\\ut2gt.exe然后一个空格，将 uTorrent 的 resume.dat 拖入窗口。再接一个空格，将 qBittorrent 的 BT_backup 文件夹拖入窗口。WIN10路径 C:\\Users\\你的用户名\\AppData\\Local\\qBittorrent\\BT_backup 例：C:\\Users\\你的用户名\\Desktop\\ut2gt.exe D:\\uTorrent\\resume.dat C:\\Users\\你的用户名\\AppData\\Local\\qBittorrent\\BT_backup然后按下回车等就OK了，会自动备份一次 resume.dat ，不信任的也可以手动备份。 原帖地址 Migrate from uTorrent to qBittorrent easilyA compiled version can be downloaded here:

时间一台Linux服务器有两个时间源，一个是硬件时间，即服务器硬件CMOS维护的时间，还有一个是软件时间，即操作系统维护的时间，前者通过hwclock命令来访问，后者则主要通过date命令来访问。 date是最常用的时间相关的命令，例如： 1234567891011# 获取当前时间$ dateFri Jan 23 15:22:16 CST 2015# 以特定格式输出当前时间，格式字符串前以&quot;+&quot;开头，例如获得当前时间的epoch$ date +%s1421998051# 设置当前时间$ sudo date -s &quot;2015-01-22 00:00:00&quot;Thu Jan 22 00:00:00 CST 2015 需要注意的是设置时间需要root的权限。 hwclock命令用于访问服务器的硬件CMOS时间，无论读取还是设置都需要root权限，例如： 123456789# 获取系统硬件时间$ sudo hwclockFri 23 Jan 2015 03:33:17 PM CST -0.567492 seconds# 设置操作系统的软件时间，与系统硬件时间同步$ sudo hwclock -s# 设置系统硬件时间，与操作系统的软件时间同步$ sudo hwclock -w 主机的硬件时间实际上是宿主机的操作系统时间。由于宿主机时间通过NTP服务做了时间同步，相对准确。如果发现云主机的操作系统时间不对，可以执行hwclock -s来校正时间。 时间同步Linux操作系统维护的软件时间随着服务器的长时间运行会出现漂移，最终会越来越不准确。不准确的系统时间会对依赖时间的服务带来影响，例如数据库，认证等，因此需要维持一个相对准确的服务器时间。 目前，一般通过ntp服务来将本地时间和线上的时间服务保持同步，维护一个相对准确的系统时间。 CentOS下安装配置ntp服务的步骤如下： 1234567891011# 安装ntp服务的软件包sudo yum install ntp# 将ntp服务设置为缺省启动sudo chkconfig ntp on# 修改启动参数，增加-g -x参数，允许ntp服务在系统时间误差较大时也能正常工作sudo vi &#x2F;etc&#x2F;sysconfig&#x2F;ntpd# 启动ntp服务sudo service ntpd restart Ubuntu/Debian下安装配置ntp服务的步骤如下： 12345678# 安装ntp服务的软件包sudo apt-get install ntp# 修改启动参数，增加-g -x参数，允许ntp服务在系统时间误差较大时也能正常工作sudo vi &#x2F;etc&#x2F;default&#x2F;ntp# 启动ntp服务sudo service ntp restart ntp服务运行后，可以通过如下命令查看与上游时间服务器的同步情况： 1234567# ntpq -p remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset

uTorrent Classic。 通过诱骗受害者访问恶意网站发动攻击Ormandy 表示，这两个 uTorrent 客户端暴露了端口 10000 (uTorrent Classic) 和端口 19575 (uTorrent Web) 上的 RPC 服务器。 Ormandy 指出，攻击者能够将命令隐藏在与这个开放 RPC 服务器交互的网页中。攻击者只需诱骗易受攻击的 uTorrent 客户端上的用户访问一个恶意网页即可。 另外，uTorrent 客户端也易受 DNS 重新绑定攻击，即攻击者能将自己向 RPC 服务器的请求合法化。 uTorrent Web 遭受的影响最大遭受这些缺陷影响最大的是 uTorrent Web。Ormandy 指出，攻击者能够： 经由 uTorrent Web 服务器获取 RPC 服务器的“验证机密”以“完全控制 RPC 服务”。 将恶意软件下载到用户的计算机上。 更改默认的下载文件夹位置（例如更改为 /Startup 文件夹，这样攻击者下载的东西就会在下次启动时自动执行）。 Ormandy 还表示能从 uTorrent Web 客户端上检索其它数据，不过由于他从一开始就完全攻陷了这个客户端，因此他并未开展进一步调查。 而 uTorrent Classic 客户端并未遭同样程度的暴露，Ormandy 仅能获取下载历史清单，并且能够选择从用户计算机中检索之前下载的文件，前提是这些文件还位于磁盘中。 Ormandy 为 uTorrent Web 和 uTorrent Classic 提供了演示页面，作为 PoC 成果。 部分补丁已发布uTorrent 的所属公司 BitTorrent 公司已经为 uTorrent Classic 发布了 3.5.3 Beta 版本解决这些问题，稳定版本将在这几天内发布。uTorrent Web 也已经得到更新，修复后的版本是v0.12.0.502。 Ormandy 此前也曾在 BitTorrent 公司的其它应用中发现过问题。他曾在 Transmission 客户端中找到一个类似的 RPC 服务器和 DNS 重新绑定缺陷。

binaries\\Linux\\intel\\glibc 目录中的 vlmcsd-x64-glibc。 注意：这里的 x86 和 x64 一定要根据机器的配置来选择。 2.将 vlmcsd-x64-glibc 上传到机器的 /data 目录下，并改名为 vlmcsd ，再使用下面命令给 vlmcsd 加执行权限，然后尝试执行。 12chmod u+x vlmcsd./vlmcsd 如果执行 vlmcsd 显示类似下面的结果，那么 1688 端口可能被占用： 123Warning: [::]:1688: Address already in useWarning: 0.0.0.0:1688: Address already in useFatal: Could not listen on any socket. 3.使用 ps 命令来查看执行的进程，命令如下： 1ps aux|grep vlmcsd 如果显示类似下面的结果，即为正常运行： 12root 16336 0.0 0.0 8624 120 ? Ss 11:01 0:00 ./vlmcsdroot 16390 0.0 0.0 112660 976 pts/0 R+ 11:03 0:00 grep --color=auto vlmcsd 4.将 vlmcsd 添加到开机启动并记录相关日志，使用到的命令如下： 12echo \"/data/vlmcsd -l /var/log/vlmcsd.log &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1\" &gt;&gt; /etc/rc.local chmod +x /etc/rc.local 注意：/data/vlmcsd 为 vlmcsd 的位置，/var/log/vlmcsd.log 为日志保存的位置。 5.至此 vlmcsd 已经搭建完成，重启服务器测试一下 vlmcsd 进程是否启动即可。 6.如果在 Windows 环境下可以使用客户端测试，在 binaries\\Windows\\intel 目录找到 vlmcs-Windows-x64.exe 文件，将其拖到 CDM 命令行中，并添加以下命令测试： 1-v -l 1 kms.bfdz.ink 注意：-v 是输出详细信息，-l 1表示发送 Windows 10 Enterprise G 的激活请求，kms.bfdz.ink 是我搭建好的 KMS 服务器绑定的网址。 如果返回类似下面内容，则表示 KMS 服务器搭建成功： 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334Request Parameters==================Protocol version : 6.0Client is a virtual machine : NoLicensing status : 2 (OOB grace)Remaining time (0 = forever) : 43200 minutesApplication ID : 55c92734-d682-4d71-983e-d6ec3f16059f (Windows)SKU ID (aka Activation ID) : e0b2d383-d112-413f-8a80-97f373a5820c (Windows 10 Enterprise G)KMS ID (aka KMS counted ID) : 7ba0bf23-d0f5-4072-91d9-d55af5a481b6 (Windows 10 China Government)Client machine ID : b979c2cb-3a81-45fc-b38a-995556160dd7Previous client machine ID : 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000Client request timestamp (UTC) : 2017-11-04 03:25:27Workstation name : www.amazon.orgN count policy (minimum clients): 25Connecting to :1688 ... successfulPerforming RPC bind ......

史前时代最早的封锁大约是 DNS 投毒和 IP 黑名单。具体细节这里不表，简单来说就是 1) 对于特定域名比如 google.com，你的浏览器解析不到正确的 IP 地址； 2) 即使碰巧解析到了正确的 IP 地址，由于 Google 在亚洲地区的 IP 地址就那么几个，发往这几个 IP 地址的数据包被全部丢弃（或 TCP Reset），也就导致了用户死活访问不到 google.com。 攻防战 1.0由于被封的 IP 依然是少数，而 Google 在全球的 IP 数量庞大，于是网友们很快想到了解决方案，就是使用 hosts 文件指定 IP 地址。虽然亚洲地区的 IP 被封了，但美国、欧洲甚至是南美洲依然有可以访问的地址，速度慢是慢了点，但总比上不去的好。于是 hosts 文件这个方案流行了那么一段时间。 后来封锁升级了，不是针对 IP 地址的了，而是针对每一个网络连接。受限于为数不多的几个出入境节点，网民的每一个出境网络连接实际上都被扫描过一遍。于是网络协议最初设计时，并未考虑封锁这回事，无论是 HTTP 还是 HTTPS，只需要扫描每个连接的前几十个字节，就可以得到其目标地址（域名）。HTTP 是通过其 Host 头，而 HTTPS 是通过 SNI。 至此，针对域名，没有封不掉的，只有不想封的。 在直线连接几乎不可能的之后，那就只能绕路了，也就是代理。代理的主要三种模式是 Socks、HTTP 和 VPN。三种模式各有利弊： Socks 可以代理 TCP 和 UDP 连接，但其数据包是明文的，依然逃不过上述检测； HTTP 可以有 TLS 加持，但只能代理 TCP 连接，对 UDP 无效； VPN 可以代理包含 TCP / UDP 在内的各种连接，但 VPN 会转发几乎所有的数据，在可以访问 Google 的同时，可能就不能访问优酷了（地区限制）。 然后 Shadowsocks 横空出世。 Shadowsocks 本质上是 Socks 的加密版本，可选择多种加密方式。一旦加了密，其传输的数据就无法被第三方检测了。并且 Shadowsocks 在转发数据之前，可以对其目的地进行判断，比如可以只转发去往 Google 的流量，而优酷的流量依然直连。在经常一段时间的优化之后，Shadowsocks 可以达到一个全局较快的连接速度，比上述的几个代理方式都要好。 由于 Shadowsocks 太过火爆，其作者被公安机关约谈，勒令不得继续参于相关项目的开发。 攻防战 2.0中国那么多人，要把相关人员一一找出来喝茶，也不是一件容易的事。封锁这事，还得从网络连接着手。 对于一台国内的机器往一个国外的服务器发送数据的网络连接，有两种检测方式，被动式和主动式。 被动式是指检测方只观察连接中传输的内容，当内容符合某种模式（比如关键字）的时候，就把连接中断，或者服务器 IP 列入黑名单。上述的所有封锁方式均为被动式。 而主动式指的是，当观察到一个不可识别的连接时，检测方主动发起一个去往服务器的连接，通过一些编造的数据，探测出服务器是不是一台代理服务器。 Shadowsocks 协议曾被指出一个严重的安全性问题。只需要不到 16 次主动探测，就可以 100% 断定服务器是否在运行 Shadowsocks。具体来说，初版 Shadowsocks 协议依赖于连接头部的某一个字节来读取目标地址，这个字节的取值只有三种。当这个字节的取值不合法时，Shadowsocks 会快速中断连接，否则继续读取剩下的内容。于是这一特征可被用于探测一个服务器是否为 Shadowsocks 代理。 为了应对这一探测方式，Shadowsocks 对其加密方式升级了两次。目前看来这一漏洞，以及其它可能的主动探测方式，都被避免了。 同时期还有多个流行的翻墙工具，其原理和 Shadowsocks 大同小异，这里略过。 攻防战 3.0从信息学的角度来说，Shadowsocks 协议是一个近乎完美的协议。它的数据完全随机，无法 100% 确定这个网络连接是否为 Shadowsocks。但从另一方面来说，网络数据并不是均匀分布的，保守来说，HTTP 和 HTTPS 流量占据了 70% 以上。而如果一个服务器接收的流量 90% 是杂乱无章的，那么它就很可疑了。虽然检测方不能严格证明那就是 Shadowsocks，但秀才遇到兵啊…… 既然随机数据可疑，那我们就把数据伪装成 HTTP 或者 HTTPS 好了。由于 HTTPS 是大势所趋，并且 HTTPS 传输的内容天生不可能被破解，把代理数据伪装成 HTTPS 也是一个比较合理的选择。 由于检测方无法判断一个 HTTPS 连接是正常的网站流量，还是代理。如果封锁所有的 HTTPS 流量，那无疑是一个杀敌五百，自损一千的昏招。当然急病乱投医也是有可能的…… 第二战场 1.0所有的代理工具都不是系统自带的，用户使用代理工具之前，需要先下载和安装。于是封锁下载途径也是一种封锁。Apple 就按要求移除了所有 VPN 应用。此战场防御方完败 😂 目前明面上的攻防到此为止，接下来说说一些想法和揣测 攻防战 4.0虽然流量经过了加密，但加密的只是内容，不能排除还有其它的特征。比如 TLS (HTTPS 所用的加密协议）的握手环节，客户端和服务器互相发送的数据是有规律的。比如握手三次，每一次的数据量大致是固定的。如果有一个连接，也有三次握手，每一次的数据量和 TLS 相当，但是内容是混乱的，那么这个连接是不是 Shadowsocks 连接呢？当然 Shadowsocks 有一些额外的数据，这个另说。 目前翻墙圈在这一问题上有很大的争论。对于检测方是否足够强的技术做类似的检测，以及是否有足够的把握只封代理都存在疑惑。但毫无疑问，这将是下一个值得研究的领域。 另一个热点是分布式或者P2P。 这一领域已经被 Tor 证明为成功或者失败了（取决于你怎么看待 Tor）。我个人不喜欢 Tor 因为它速度太慢。虽然 P2P 这一术语最近很热，听上去也很有希望，但实际上它并不适用于翻墙。翻墙的过程需要【墙内的P】2【墙外的P】，并不是任意两个 P 都可以自由组合的。 目前对翻墙 P2P 的研究和应用都比较少，前景不明朗，观望中。 以上是对翻墙历史的简单总结，希望对新人有帮助。

组织，以文艺小众为主题，也是世界上众多艺术类影迷的驻地，所以如果你喜欢法国电影，那么 kg 这个站点的账号是必备的。 二、 bt 论坛，在法国有许多 bt 类论坛，在下载时资源时，如果此资源未在国内被离线过，大部分都是能够通过长时间的挂离线拖下来的，这有别于之前西班牙的电驴，西班牙的电驴很多都无人续源，不论花费多长时间也不会有人来补。法国最著名的 bt 论坛即是 t411 ， t411 的资源量非常大，但是这里有几点需要注意，而且这几点对于法国其他的 bt 论坛也可以适用。 1、 t411 因为版权查处的原因，其域名会经常变化，而且会有许多“仿411”的网站出现，看资源量就很容易鉴别真伪。目前 t411 的网址是“ t411.li ”。 2、 t411 因为是境外服务器，所以中国很多网络是无法打开的，目前只有通过“翻墙”才能进入。 3、 t411 的种子资源需要通过注册账号登陆才能下载，这与俄罗斯的 rutracker 一致，不过 rutracker 更好的一点是其内部的磁链可以在不登陆账号的情况下直接使用。 4、虽然 t411 里面也像 pt 那样记载下载与上传量，但是 t411 并不是 pt 而是 bt ，也就是说你下载的种子，给任何其他人使用下载也是可以的。 5、下载 t411 里面的种子使用迅雷就好，如果有条件的话还可以使用 Windows 版的盒子，利用 ut 进行下载，基本也可以达到满速。 6、 t411 下载种子是点击资源页面最下方的“ Télécharger ”，也就是法语的“下载”。 三、在线站点，法国免费的在线站点比较多，如“ papystreaming ”，点击即看，但大部分都是主流电影，平时收集一些就好，不必刻意关注，因为在线看会卡，所以如果你不是身在国外，还是建议将资源下载本地观看。另外法国也有一些付费在线站点，其付费资源也都是相对珍贵的，如“ ina ”，使用 Paypal 或者 Visa 等带有国际支付功能的账户就可以购买下载权限。 四、网盘博客，这个是很重点的部分，因为法国的网盘博客极多，但很多都因是“ blogspot 形式”博客而被国内所屏蔽，所以这再次告诉我们想要获取好的资源，“翻墙”本领是必备的。而且法国博客里的资源都相对稀缺，与在线站点形成鲜明对比。因为博客的个人属性比较强，所以在上传电影的时候，很多都是以个人的兴趣爱好为主题，也就是说很多电影是法国网友通过自压购买的 DVD，VHS 或者录制电视资源而得到，所以其质量也比在线大杂烩要高出许多。例如“ lantredelhorreur ”惊悚谋杀类，“ four-tous ”家庭动作类，“ zomblardsfromouterspace ”丧尸恐怖类，“ muaddib-sci-fi ”智能科幻类等等。这类博客的下载方式都是网盘，但一般一个电影会给出多个网盘的下载地址，所以在下载的时候，一定要尽量选择那种直接快速的，避免时间的浪费以及资源的断传。 五、译名资源，讲这块关系到一些搜索技巧，因为法国网站也存在着大量的国外电影，所以如果找对一部电影的法国译名就很重要，一般我们可以通过 IMDb 上的“ asknowsa ”来进行法语译名的查询，但是有许多电影的法语译名并没有标注在 IMDb 里，这个时候我们可以利用一下法国的豆瓣“ allocine ”来进行搜索查找，输入影片的英文名，一般会出现其对应的法文译名，再利用之前的 Google 关键词堆砌的方法来进行搜索，就会相对快速的找到一些网址链接。当然这些也不是绝对的，很多时候用“ allocine ”搜索并不会出现对应结果，但实际其在数据库是存在的，只是因为单词输入的细微误差原因导致无法看到正确的条目，所以我们尽量多查多找，反复试验才行，这需要强大的耐心，一般人估计很快就放弃了，只有坚持到最后的人才能挖掘到最可贵的东西。 好了，以上是目前可以想到的一些，先写出来供大家参考，实际资源搜索的时候会遇到各种各样的新鲜情况，只有不断积累经验，才能达到理想的目标，如果你对资源感兴趣，那么就反复去尝试吧，很多时候会有意外的收获，也必将会对稀有电影这个领域做出卓越的贡献。 内容为原创手打，转载请注名出处，谢谢。

的数据。 一、海盗湾网址：http://thepiratebay.org/ 无需多介绍。海盗湾建站十三年来，历经多次打击和关站风波，再一次坐上了第一的宝座。 二、ExtraTorrent网址：http://extratorrent.cc/（主域名被封，可以备用域名访问 http://extra.to/） ExtraTorrent 的用户群一直在稳步增长。据该网站的创始人所说，ExtraTorrent 活跃的用户论坛是网站成功的主要原因。该网站还拥有自己的发布组：ETTV 和 ETRG。 三、RARBG网址：http://rarbg.to/ RARBG 是一个保加利亚的 BT 站，成立于2008年。该站在新电影和电视剧方面更新速度较快，并且会修改种子带上自己的网站名，所以知名度也提升的很快。 四、YTS.AG网址:

该站在去年发生过部分管理员和版主抗议安全问题的事，不过现在已经有了很大的进展。 七、TorrentProject网址：http://torrentproject.se/ TorrentProject 在 BT 站里是算是个老面孔，不过却是首次出现在前十。该网站是个磁力链类 BT 站，目前网站数据库里的种子数超过千万。 八、EZTV.AG网址：http://eztv.ag/ 网站内容主要是英美剧资源。域名换了很多次，目前网站运营团队不知是不是原来的。 九、TorrentDownloads网址：http://torrentdownloads.me/ 老牌种子站，已经建站数年。该站支持匿名上传种子。 十、Limetorrents网址：https://www.limetorrents.cc/ 该站是一个种子搜索引擎，网站不存储种子，使用来自其他站的搜索结果和磁力链接。

下载视频，ffms 出了问题，这导致视频合并不了。ffms的问题一时解决不了，看着一堆分割的ts文件，只有想办法合并视频。 然后找到了一个合并工具 HD Remuxer ，这款软件和tsMuxer类似，但合并分块视频的功能更优秀。全选同一个文件夹内的ts文件，自动按文件名排序合并，而tsMuxer只有单选追加模式。 注意支持合并的视频格式有TS\\MTS\\M2T\\M2TS四种，但是合并的视频必须是相同编码的若干段，否则一定会出问题。为简化操作，默认合并输出的文件名为Final.ts由于经常出现因为视频关键帧导致合并后的视频时间轴显示不正确的问题，所以工具内置了视频时间修复功能(依附TSmuxer程序)，在菜单——》修复时间中开启。界面语言在理论上应该是支持简繁系统，如果出现乱码也没办法。 1.本工具必须位于【全英文】的路径下，否则eac3to无法正常工作。 正确：D:\\HD Remuxer 或者 D:\\Program Files\\HD Remuxer （只要是全英文路径均可）错误：D:\\测试\\HD Remuxer 或者 D:\\Program Files\\工具\\HD Remuxer （含有非英文字符则会出错） 2.需要进行视频拆分的文件，请确保文件名中【不含有非英文及其他特殊字符】，否则eac3to可能无法正常执行命令。 Changelog： V1.1.4.8 (2016年01月10日) 1.修复 低配置电脑[合并视频模式]可能无响应 V1.1.4.7 (2016年01月02日) 1.新增 合并视频模式显示进度条 [一键合并模式不显示]2.优化 小体积视频片段的合并算法3.更新 FFmpeg

BootstrapCDN是支持HTTPS的，所以也方便了博客启用HTTPS。这里不但将CloudFlare的jQuery替换成了Bootstrap的，随后还进行了一个判断，如果获取BootstrapCDN的jQuery失败，则使用本网站自己的jQuery。为了让这段代码有效，我们要去jQuery官方下载合适版本的jQuery并将其放到 \\themes\\landscape-plus\\source\\js 目录下。还有一点需要特别注意，那就是jQuery这个文件在Hexo生产博客时会被解析，因此一定要将jQuery文件开头处的 //@ sourceMappingURL=jquery-2.0.3.min.map 这一行代码删去，否则会导致博客无法生成。 完全启用 HTTPS我的另一篇博文(LNMP配置启用HTTPS)讲了在LNMP环境下为网站配置HTTPS的方法，但博客在启用HTTPS后会遇到了一些资源不能使用HTTPS的问题。 多说头像和表情我的博客采用的是多说评论系统，第三方登录的帐号，其评论头像往往不支持HTTPS。这样导致了Chrome会出现警告，网站也没有小绿锁。我采用的解决方法是将头像用支持HTTPS的CDN做代理，github上面有个现成项目：duoshuo-https 修改 \\themes\\landscape-plus\\layout\\_partial\\after-footer.ejs 第11行, 将 1&#39;&#x2F;&#x2F;static.duoshuo.com&#x2F;embed.js&#39; 替换成 1&#39;&#x2F;&#x2F;dn-hb0716.qbox.me&#x2F;duoshuo.js&#39; 关闭分享按钮主题自带的百度分享同样对HTTPS的支持有问题，在个可在主题配置文件中关闭。关闭后分享按钮又恢复成Hexo默认的了，我感觉这个功能也没啥用，所以关闭之。默认分享按钮在Hexo主配置没有关闭的地方，找到 /landscape-plus/blob/master/layout/_partial/article.ejs , 删除或注视掉26-30行。其内容如下 12345&lt;% if

__(&#39;share&#39;) %&gt;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;% &#125; %&gt; 自动切换 banner 图片显示banner和标题透明首先要让banner显示出来，Landscape-plus主题为了优化速度默认不显示banner。然后去掉博客名的红色背景色，改成透明的，这样防止影响banner图的效果。主要是修改这个文件 themes/landscape-plus/source/css/_partial/header.styl 的第33行，将这一行 // background: url(banner-url) center #000 替换成 background: center #000 ，同时也要注释掉第13、16、32行。第56行修改成 background: rgba(0,0,0,0.2) ,最后一个数字是透明度，可以自己调节。 自动切换 banner 图片的代码和具体方法是另一位博主写的，下面是直接引用他的博文： 添加随机切换图片的脚本首先要在themes/landscape-plus/layout/_partial/下新建一个ejs文件，我将其命名为switch-banner.ejs，其中是用于切换banner图片的Javascript代码，代码会每个小时将6张图片轮换一次，也就相当于每10分钟换一张。该文件内容如下： 12345678910&lt;script&gt; &lt;% if (theme.switch_banner)&#123; %&gt; var d &#x3D; new Date(); var m &#x3D; d.getMinutes(); var num &#x3D; Math.ceil((m + 1) &#x2F; (60 &#x2F; &lt;%- theme.banner_count %&gt;)); document.getElementById(&quot;banner&quot;).style.backgroundImage &#x3D; &quot;url(&#x2F;css&#x2F;images&#x2F;banner&quot; + num + &quot;.jpg)&quot;; &lt;% &#125; else &#123; %&gt; document.getElementById(&quot;banner&quot;).style.backgroundImage &#x3D; &quot;url(&#x2F;css&#x2F;images&#x2F;banner.jpg)&quot;; &lt;% &#125; %&gt;&lt;&#x2F;script&gt; 代码也比较简单，通过JavaScript的Date对象的getMinutes()来获取当前时间的分钟数，这是一个0～59的数，然后经过一点小算术映射到图片的文件名的编号，注意处理边界情况。 这里还有一个小修改，就是将图片的张数改成了可配置的，而不是硬编码的。这就需要在Landscape-plus模板的配置文件中设置一个数字。在themes/landscape-plus/_config.yml中添加一行banner_count: 6。请根据实际图片的张数来修改这个数字。 banner图片要放到 themes/landscape/source/css/images/ 目录下，命名为

python版虽然自带有多用户配置功能，但无法限制用户流量。而ss-panel+ss-manyuser的多用户分享方案偏商业用途，部署和配置都比较繁琐，数据库和web面板都有不小的资源占用。hellofwy所写的ss-bash的脚本则完美解决了这个问题，下面是这个脚本的简介、安装和注意事项说明： 简介ss-bash无论是启动、停止，还是添加用户，修改流量限制，都是使用命令，十分简洁、方便。ss-bash原理是使用iptables规则获取各端口的流量，一个端口代表一个用户。脚本循环运行，在固定时间间隔根据iptables结果统计流量使用情况，并在流量超过限制时，添加对应端口的iptables reject规则以禁用端口。 系统要求为Linux Debian/Ubuntu，shadowsocks python版，iptables需要正常工作中。目前只支持统计ipv4流量。 github网址：https://github.com/hellofwy/ss-bash 安装更新 1apt-get update 安装pip 1apt-get install python-pip -y 安装shadowsocks 1pip install shadowsocks 安装unzip和bc，bc是使用ss-bash的必备工具。 12apt-get install unzipapt-get install bc 下载ss-bash 12wget https://github.com/hellofwy/ss-bash/archive/master.zipunzip master.zip 使用查看帮助 12cd

out。解决方法：说明是服务器端口被封，尝试换一个端口。 2、日志记录远程计算机关闭或无法连接，说明shadowsocks没有启动。可能是vps宕机重启后shadowsocks没有启动。解决方法：启动shadowsocks，并为其添加开机启动。 3、修改加密方式。编辑配置文件 ssmlt.template 即可，例如加密方式改为chacha20 123\"server\":

的数据库全量备份或选择备份；2、支持指定目录或文件的备份；3、支持加密备份文件（需安装 openssl 命令，可选）；4、支持上传至 Google Drive（需先安装 gdrive 并配置，可选）；5、支持在删除指定天数本地旧的备份文件的同时，也删除 Google Drive 上的同名文件（可选）。 2016 年 8 月 21 日更新：1、新增：指定 MySQL/MariaDB 的数据库名进行备份，可以同时指定多个；2、新增：删除指定天数本地旧的备份文件。 2016 年 9 月 8 日更新：1、新增：删除指定天数本地旧的备份文件的同时，可选删除 Google Drive 上的同名文件，以节约空间。 教程模式开启： 1、下载该脚本并赋予执行权限12wget https://github.com/teddysun/across/raw/master/backup.shchmod +x backup.sh 2、修改并配置脚本请使用 vim 或 nano 等工具来修改。 关于变量名的一些说明： ENCRYPTFLG（加密FLG，true 为加密，false 为不加密，默认是加密）BACKUPPASS（加密密码，重要，务必要修改）LOCALDIR（备份目录，可自己指定）TEMPDIR（备份目录的临时目录，可自己指定）LOGFILE（脚本运行产生的日志文件路径）MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD（MySQL 或 MariaDB 的 root 用户密码）MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME（指定 MySQL 数据库名，留空则是备份所有数据库）※ MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME 是一个数组变量，可以指定多个。举例如下： 12MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME[0]=\"phpmyadmin\"MYSQL_DATABASE_NAME[1]=\"test\" BACKUP（需要备份的指定目录或文件列表，留空就是不备份目录或文件） ※ BACKUP 是一个数组变量，可以指定多个。举例如下： 123BACKUP[0]=\"/data/www/default/test.tgz\"BACKUP[1]=\"/data/www/default/test/\"BACKUP[2]=\"/data/www/default/test2/\" LOCALAGEDAILIES（指定多少天之后删除本地旧的备份文件，默认为 7 天）DELETE_REMOTE_FILE_FLG（删除 Google Drive 上的备份文件FLG，true 为删除，false 为不删除，默认是删除） 一些注意事项的说明： 1）脚本需要用 root 用户来执行；2）脚本需要用到 openssl 来加密，请事先安装好；3）脚本默认备份所有的数据库（全量备份）；4）备份文件的解密命令如下： 1openssl enc -aes256 -in [ENCRYPTED BACKUP] -out decrypted_backup.tgz -pass pass:[BACKUPPASS] -d -md sha1 5）备份文件解密后，解压命令如下： 1tar -zxPf [DECRYPTION BACKUP FILE] 解释一下参数 -P：tar 压缩文件默认都是相对路径的。加个 -P 是为了 tar 能以绝对路径压缩文件。因此，解压的时候也要带个 -P 参数。 3、配置 gdrive 命令gdrive 是一个命令行工具，用于 Google Drive 的上传下载等操作。官网网站：https://github.com/prasmussen/gdrive 当然，你可以用以下的命令来安装 gdrive。 x86_64（64位）： 12wget -O /usr/bin/gdrive http://dl.teddysun.com/files/gdrive-linux-x64chmod +x /usr/bin/gdrive i386（32位） 12wget -O /usr/bin/gdrive http://dl.teddysun.com/files/gdrive-linux-386chmod +x /usr/bin/gdrive 然后，运行以下命令开始获取授权： 1gdrive about 根据提示用浏览器打开 gdrive 给出的 URL，点击接受（Accept），然后将浏览器上显示出来的字符串粘贴回命令行里，完成授权。 4、运行脚本开始备份1./backup.sh 脚本默认会显示备份进度，并在最后统计出所需时间。如果你想将脚本加入到 cron 自动运行的话，就不需要前台显示备份进度，只写日志就可以了。这个时候你需要稍微改一下脚本中的 log 函数。 1234log() &#123; echo \"$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\" \"$1\" echo -e \"$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\" \"$1\" &gt;&gt; $&#123;LOGFILE&#125;&#125; 改为： 123log() &#123; echo -e \"$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\")\" \"$1\" &gt;&gt; $&#123;LOGFILE&#125;&#125; 关于如何使用 cron 自动备份，以 CentOS 6 来举例说明。 修改文件 /etc/crontab，内容如下： 12345678910111213141516SHELL=/bin/bashPATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:~/binMAILTO=rootHOME=/root# For details see man 4 crontabs# Example of job definition:# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)# | .------------- hour (0 - 23)# | | .---------- day of month (1 - 31)# | | | .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...# | | | | .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat# | | | | |# * * * * * user-name command to be executed30 1 * * * root bash /root/backup.sh 以上表示，每天凌晨 1 点 30 分，root 用户执行一次 backup.sh 脚本。 注意：一定要修改其中的 PATH 和 HOME 变量的值。尤其是 HOME 变量，gdrive 命令能否正确执行，是要依赖于其配置文件的。默认用 root 配置的话，其配置文件夹应该是 /root/.gdrive/ ，所以要更改 HOME 的值。 最后，欢迎交流和提出意见。 转载来源：秋水逸冰 »

对于低延迟的网络（如日本，香港等），可以使用htcp，可以非常显著的提高速度，首先使用modprobe tcp_htcp开启，再将net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = hybla改为net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control = htcp，建议EC2日本用户使用这个算法。 ####1.2

3 然后把vi /etc/shadowsocks.json配置文件中”fast_open”: false改为”fast_open”: true。这样速度也将会有非常显著的提升。 2. 加密层面####2.1 安装M2Crypto这个可以提高SS的加密速度，安装办法：Debian/Ubuntuapt-get install python-m2crypto安装之后重启SS，速度将会有一定的提升 CentOS先安装依赖包：yum install -y openssl-devel gcc swig python-devel autoconf libtool安装setuptools： 12wget --no-check-certificate https:&#x2F;&#x2F;raw.githubusercontent.com&#x2F;iMeiji&#x2F;shadowsocks_install&#x2F;master&#x2F;ez_setup.pypython ez_setup.py install 再通过pip安装M2Crypto：pip install M2Crypto或者pip install M2Crypto --upgrade ####2.2 安装 gevent安装 gevent可以提高 Shadowsocks 的性能。Debian/Ubuntu 123456apt-get install python-devapt-get install libevent-devapt-get install python-setuptoolsapt-get install python-geventeasy_install greenleteasy_install gevent CentOS 123yum install -y libeventpip install greenletpip install gevent ####2.3 使用CHACHA20加密算法首先，安装libsodium，让系统支持chacha20算法。Debian/Ubuntu 12345apt-get install build-essentialwget https:&#x2F;&#x2F;download.libsodium.org&#x2F;libsodium&#x2F;releases&#x2F;LATEST.tar.gztar xf LATEST.tar.gz &amp;&amp;

Scenelingo对于Scene的解释：The “Scene”, when used in this context, is used to describe the underground culture devoted to releasing movies, reverse-engineering and cracking software, and ripping music, and releasing these things on the internet. Scene， 可以译为“业界”，通常理解为一个圈子，类似于工商界，学界这样的概念。广义上的”业界”指在一个圈子里的一些人或机构以及他们之间错综复杂的关系总和， 用户则被排斥于业界之外。通俗地说，Scene就是松散的非盈利性盗版制作发行联盟。这个联盟内部没有上下级的领导，但是有着自己正式和非正式的约定。 Scene也可以理解为各个盗版小组发行和交换资源的整个体系的总体称呼。 关键词三：Scene Group所 谓的Scene Group是Scene这个联盟内的若干个小组，可以是很多人合作，也可以是个人操作，但是无论Group是以何种形式组织，其操作都是试图将影视、音 乐、游戏、软件等资源经过抓取、压缩等技术的操作之后通过互联网进行传播。他们传播的作品我们称为Release，简称rlz，Scene Group是rlz Group的一种类型，但并非所有的rlz group都是Scene Group。(主页君注：不是rls？) 维基百科对于Release Groups的解释:Release Groups A.k.a rlz GroupA number of people working together to obtain and release new games, utilities or patches on to the net. A release is made when a correctly packaged file is uploaded to a private FTP for other release group members to access. Release groups generally follow a set of rules governing the correct etiquette to package releases, failure to do so results in a Nuke. Many groups have specialised in releasing games for a particular console. Releases that come from an individual not belonging to any group are usually labeled as Independent. 这个定义点出了rlz group的一些特点：Internet，FTP，release 但是对象并不完整，事实上的Release Groups发布对象涵盖影视、软件、游戏、音乐、资料等各种数据资源。 每个rlz group发布作品均包含说明该发布作品的NFO文件，此文件主要包含发布组信息、发布作品的信息、破解信息等。nfo文件可通过专门的软件查看，也可使用系统自带的记事本查看。 在目前国内比较权威的0day信息发布平台xtm的BBS上，rlz group的作品被主要分为了四个板块： 关键词四：Topsite，简称TS### 维基百科对于Topsite的解释:Topsite is a term used by the warez scene to refer to high-speed FTP servers used by release groups and couriers for distribution, storage and archiving of warez releases. Topsite 是一个Warez术语。由私密的Irc和FTP组成，Irc用于Scene Group成员的交流，FTP则用于Scene Group发布Warez。进入IRC需要对申请者进行极严格的审查，包括技术、资源甚至是人品，而FTP的限制则更为严格，甚至只能在限定的IP地址段 内才能登录。一般Topsite拥有Tb级的硬盘和100Mbit以上的宽带。 根据Scene Rules，Scene group会把自己发布的视频类作品用WinRAR压缩成一定大小的多个分包，以便于分流，这也是为什么我们会经常看到一些文件由若干个rar压缩包组成的原因。 一个Topsite通常包含若干个group（即Scene Group，简称grp），每个grp的核心领袖称OP，grp是WareZ的直接制造者，他们的作品最终汇总到topsite中进行统一发布。在每个 topsite中，又有详细的分工，以MovieZ为例：负责提供原材料（DVD、Bluray-Disc等原盘）的supplier，负责抓取压制的 ripper，负责传输到TS上的racer等。 有些topsite的成员，会将topsite的作品传到自己所在的其他FTP（非Topsite）里，这种行为称dump。从TS上获取WareZ的FTP站点称为Dump站。通 常Scene Group在TS上会进行竞赛，也就是race，比较哪个grp发布的速度最快发布的作品品质最好，其主要原则是，对于同一种资源，如果有一个grp最先 发布出来，除非nuke，否则其他grp的rlz就不再被允许发布到TS上。TS服务器一般都带有各种验证工具和脚本会自动计算race后的结果，也就是 credit，类似于PT站点的ratio。grp的racer参与race的过程，以维持grp在TS中的位置，若长期排在末位则会被TS ban掉，因并非所有的grp成员都有TS帐号，grp通常内部会有自己的dump站，racer也需负责将TS上的Warez搬运到Dump站来，供 grp的其他成员分享。Topsite上还有一类特殊leech帐号，提供给对TS做出特殊贡献的人（supplier，retirer或者捐助者）使用 者不需要参与race，因此不受race结果限制而可以随意的分享TS上的Warez。 Warez hierarchy（等级）： 关键词五：pre/pretime###pre 是指某grp成员将制作好的资源上传到topsite后（首先上传到小组内部目录），把资源转移到topsite上所有用户有下载权限的目录里，同时脚本 会自动在该TS的IRC上发布该rlz的相关信息。此过程称“preing”而这段时间则称为pretime，此后这一个rlz状态变成pre‘d（前提 是不出BUG，有问题则会被nuked。其他小组如果继续发布相同的资源则会被dupe，除非某其他的grp制作出更好rlz，此时这个更好的rlz会标 注tag proper 另外pretime也可以理解为从release被上传到TS后到资源被制作成种子并发布这段时间。一些0day方向的PT站会在资源中注明pretime，以强调自身转发的速度，对于普通用户而言，pretime并没有太多实际意义。 在介绍iNT组之前依然先说明几个概念： Non-Scene Group#### Non-Scene Group是区别于Scene Group的一些小组，这些小组不参与Topsite上的race，通过其他渠道发布自己的资源。按照作品的传播途径，又分为P2P Group和其他的Group。 Warez意义上的P2P的概念详见此条目：http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%AA%94%E6%A1%88%E5%88%86%E4%BA%AB/ 国内比较流行的P2P主要有PT、BT、以及电驴（请注意电驴不等于verycd及其继承的simplecd）。 我们常见的通过PT站点发布rlz的 WiKi、CHD等即属于P2P Group。而有些小组，只通过Usenet发布作品，其传播方式有别于P2P，只能成为其他的非P2P小组。在国外还有一种比较流行的资源分享渠道，即 Usenet，关于其具体方式可以参看此文： USENET简介推广UsenetUsenet：P2P下载的替代方法 总而言之，P2P是Non-Scene Group进行作品传播的一种方式。Scene Group的成员大多非很反感P2P网络，常常会在rlz的NFO中附注“Fuck P2P”等字眼，因此虽然Scene的很多rlz最终还是流入到P2P网络之中，但Non-Scene Group，特别是其中的P2P Group和Scene Group是两个没有交集的部分，也就是说，不存在一个小组，既参与TS上的race，同时又自发的在P2P网络中发布小组作品，将Scene的rlz流 传出来至多只能算Scene成员的个人行为。 在Non-Scene Group中，大部分的小组选择长期驻守在某个site上发布资源，我们称这些小组为某个site的内部发行组，即Internal组，简称iNT组。比 较著名的iNT组如HDB的CtrlHD、DON、Ebp、ESiR，TTG的WiKi，CHD的CHD等。早年国内著名的几个DVDrip小组 KiSS、NewMov还有韩国的WAF也都属于iNT组。 需要区别的是，在Scene里面，也有internal的概念，其具体含义是：不太符合TDX标准（参见此帖）的作品，一些是Scene Group的成员自己个人随性制做，质量比较差，另一些则是grp认为依照TDX标准无法做出满意的质量,比如其中bitrate限制和codec限制过 于死板等，但不依照TDX做又会被NUKE，于是做成不参与race，只在自己的site内部传阅的作品，这种internal比较有收藏价值。所有这些 作品都会在命名里标记上iNT。因此，iNT组和iNT作品是两码事，Scene组偶尔也会制作一些iNT rlz。 Encode-重编码作品####发布组（rlz group）利用其内部渠道获得的DVD或Bluray-Disc片源，通过转换视频的编码格式（目前比较流行的是XVID和H264），达到压缩体积的 目的，最终封装后缀名为avi、mp4、mkv的文件我们称之为重编码作品，这个过程的制作者我们称为Encoder。 以下局限在高清影视领域讨论各Group的Encode： 由Scene，0day一些概念的简单解释可知：Scene组为了参与在TS上的race，时间成为他们首要考虑因素，只要压制出来的作品看上去没有太大的技术问题，就会发布出来。而驻守在各个 site上的iNT组则追求慢工出细活，将压制作品的品质放在首位，时间次之，因此在影视资源的品质上，iNT组是明显优于Scene组的。不过一个很好 玩的现状是，由于现在几个知名的Internal Group驻守的PT站点为了增强自身的竞争力，常会经由一些独占渠道抢先发布资源，结果是Internal组比Scene组发布速度还快。必须指出的 是，虽然从整体上看，iNT组所发布的作品画质确实优于Scene组（因为遵照High Definition x264 Standards Revision 4.0 的标准，Scene组压制的高清影视只能跑固定的参数），但是并不意味着Scene组的作品不可接受，在著名的PT站点SceneHD，只有Scene Group的作品是允许被上传的。 而TOP组这个概念，其实只在国内一些小圈子里流行，国外并无TOP Group的说法。 此概念最早由NHD的管理层提出，用于减少其站内的电影资源内容上的重复。 其最早的规则如下： Scene &amp; Internal, from Group to Quality-Degree. ONLY FOR HD-resources [Ver 1.1] 从发布组名称，定义画质分级 只适用于相同分辨率标准的高清压制作品 顶级： 能在NexusHD上发布的最终版本。DON, CtrlHD, EbP, THORA, HDC另外， 任何质量接近于片源或者以上顶级压制组出品版本的作品同样享受此待遇。 (必须有无损的截图对比，适用于以下等级。 不错：WiKi, EuReKa, HDxT, HiDT, ATHD, FraMeSToR, ESiR6 还行：CHD, HDS, MySiLU, XTM, FoRM, CRiSC, SoW 0day发布：速度远重于画质METiS, MELiTE, CBGB, LCHD, aBD, SiNNERS, REVEiLL, CiNEFiLE, hV, HALCYON, aAf, OUTDATED,DIMENSION, CTU, ORENJi,

发布优先级自高到低为从顶级到0day，任何PROPER（修正版）/REPACK（重制版）随时欢迎（适用于同等级）。我们同样提倡NexusHD会员自制作品的发布，但是画质一定要过关哦。。 举例如下： 如果站内已经有WALL-E的iNFAMOUS 720p版本，那么你可以上传WiKi的压制版本。之后，持有CtrlHD版本的会员可以随时上传但CHD版本不被允许。同样适用于1080p的发布标准旧的资源不会被人为删除。 此标准里的0day，指的是参与高清影视制作的Scene Group，其他小组多为驻守在各个PT站或BBS的Internal Group（比较奇怪的是SoW，这个组经确认为德国的一个Scene Group）。 此压制组分级标准随后被六维等PT站点引用，作为其Dupe制度的参考。NHD这个标准里，被划为顶级的几个组几乎都是HDB的Internal Group，且HDB一直凭借其高品质的重编码作品及入站的高门槛在众多PTer有着良好的口碑，加之该标准英文版将顶级译为TOP，故在某些高清发烧友 眼中，TOP组就是指部分HDB的iNT组，TOP组的概念也由此推广开来。 需要的说明是： 1.NHD的这个分级制度在大范围内其实并不被认可，即使在同一个小组（即使用相同的小组签名）也会因为理念的差异、经验的累积导致作品质量参差不齐。部分国外的资深PTer认为Encoder（即压制成员）比压制组更有参考价值。 2.X264编码技术在近几年的飞速更新也是一个需要考虑的因素，从今天的眼光来看，三年前发布大量作品的ESiR组的rlz品质未见得优于现在的一些新组，尽管当时的ESiR为全球Internal Group之翘楚。 小结：####一个通俗易懂的结论： Scene = SpeedInternal = QualityTOP组，也就是HDB的几个小组CtrlHD、DON、Ebp、ESiR整体而言作品质量较高，且发布的资源数量也非常多，在国内流传度非常高，他们的rlz是高清发烧友值得考虑的收藏对象。 部分Scene Group的简介：###Immerse 这个组在Scene可谓声名狼藉，在TS上为了race无所不用其极，经常发布劣质的encode，在YYETS的论坛，Immerse被人戏称为“骑兵 组”或“马赛克小组”该组为了抢快经常用很低的码率和参数，作品不是播放没有声音就是花屏，常年在TS上被Proper。喜欢美剧的混一些外站的PTer 应当特别留心这个组，很可能在别的站还没下载完就被网站的管理员删档了。 同样是以发布美剧闻名的CTU、DIMENSION、ORENJi、SYS等组则很少出现这样的问题。 Japhson 常常能看到这个组Proper其他Scene的作品。 LCHD LooKMaNe 多发布亚洲影视作品。 SoW 这个组多发布德语电影 CiNEFiLE和SiNNERS以压制720P欧美电影为主的小组，作品流传度很广 AMIABLE、Felony、METiS往往抢发大片，值得一提的是，METiS一度和iNT组共用片源，有些国外站因此误将METiS和WiKi视为同一个小组，将WiKi划入Scene组名单当中。 TWiZTED 这个组经常会出Repack，自己压坏了之后赶紧重做。 附注的是，很多组会身披不同马甲做标清视频和高清视频，目前已知的是： XII=IMMERSE（做标清的XII也压坏了很多美剧），FQM=CTU（冰与火之歌的第一季的0day版想必很多人还记得，标清的多是FQM的，高清的多是CTU的）LOL=DIMENSION，ORENJi=XOR以及IMBT=METiS 部分Non-Scene Group介绍：###高清PT站点HDB的Intenal Group,部分被视为TOP组： CtrlHD、CRiSC、DON、Ebp、ESiR、HDL、HDmonSK、HDxT、iLL、MMI、PerfectionHD、Prestige、RuDe3 被称为HDB三大组的CtrlHD、DON、ESiR，以高质量和众多数量的Encode在PT圈内享有盛誉，ESiR的720P更是曾在PT界首屈一指， 风行于国内各大资源站点。ESiR由Thor小组演化而成，后又分离出Thora这样专心从事动漫的压制组。10年4月ESiR因内部问题人员变动，作品 质量和数量下滑，现已不在HDB发片，但HDB站内依然有大量ESiR的重编码作品。如今ESiR的地位已被Ebp取代，后者与CtrlHD、DON继续 在HDB成三足鼎立之势。 HDmonSK、PerfectionHD则在HDB以发布BD原盘为主，不时也会释出一些Encode。 iLL、MMI、RuDe以制作720P的HDTV为主，iLL一度是与CtrlHD、DON、ESiR并驾齐驱的四大组，现iLL、MMI已式微，只有RuDe仍不时可见作品放出。 HDxT之前曾一度同时入驻HDB、HDC，其作品流传度不高，但质量很高。 CRiSC、HDL、都是压制重编码作品的小组，其压制水平和压制数量都较三大组为逊色。 DDR 这个组目前只知道在HDB主要发布印度电影，但是在HDB官方小组的list上没有这个组，因此未列在上面 注： 如今的三大组CtrlHD、DON、Ebp除以BD原盘为片源压制1080P和720P外，不时也会发布原盘和HDTV，今年最火爆的美剧《冰与火之歌》 CtrlHD即录制了前六集的1080i，而Ebp则利用CtrlHD及其他小组录制的1080i为片源压制了720P。 三大组中不时可见国人活跃的身影，CtrlHD的Fransky目前依然以CtrlHD的签名发布着高品质的Encode,曾经是CtrlHD成员的 dizhuwang（linghuteng）压制水平很高，现在建立了LiNG的单人小组，曾先后是DON、WiKi成员的Jaychu128则将HDB 先进的压制理念带入到了国内，Prestige是他在HDB建立的个人小组。 3.HDB由于站内的Dupe制度，其重编码的720P、1080P每种仅允许保留一个作品，因此CtrlHD在其他小组发布了encode之后，会通过Usenet等途径将本组重复压制的作品流出来。 高清PT站点HDT的Intenal Group：###DNL、EuReKA、HDMaNiAcS、HiDT、KRaLiMaRKo、ViSTA™、 HDT 的几个压制组在P2P圈内也有一定的声望。HiDT主要压制720P作品，ViSTA™则以1080P为主，两个iNT组作品在国外PT站流传度较广，在 国内相对少见。ViSTA™似乎是单人小组，现在已经消失。KRaLiMaRKo和HDMaNiAcS为新加入的小组，前者专门制作remux，后者则压 制720P、1080P不等。DNL的作品不时在国内会见到转发，不过转发的也以720P HDTV多见。这三个小组的品质相对HiDT、ViSTA™这样的老牌还有很大的提升空间。 EuReKA 像是PT圈子里的浪子，最早在Bit-HDTV上发布作品，08年底和Bit-HDTV的staff争吵后自行建站Eureka.org，后来站点出现状 况，转头Awsome-HD，因为感觉自己制作BD25伪原盘的理念在HDT无法的得到重视，现又离开自行成立PT站BD25（http://bd25.org/）且由原来重编码压制1080P改为制作BD5、BD9、BD25伪原盘。 FraMeSToR这 个组是从EuReKA分离出来的小组。曾先后在Bit-HDTV、HDME等PT站常驻发布1080P，特点是封装无损音轨及次世代音轨，现自行建立PT 站点tracker.framestor-hd.org，其压制极为严苛，码率往往非常高，封装次世代音轨后有时1080P的encode比原盘还大。 HDBRise此小组为罗马尼亚PT站HDBits.ro(注意是ro)的iNT组，主要以压制电影和音乐类视频（演唱会、音乐剧等）为主，既以原盘压制720P、1080P，也不时以HDTV压制720P作品，该小组在站外转发较多的作品主要是其音乐类视频。 FLAWL3SS 这个组部分作品较好，但是经常会压制HDrip、BRrip，所以并不推荐 下面国内的：WiKi、NGB两 个组最早都是驻守在HDC的iNT组，WiKi以BD为片源压制720P、1080P，NGB则以自录的HDTV压制720P剧集综艺。现均以离开 HDC，驻守在TTG发布作品。WiKi是由著名的DVDrip小组KiSS的组长天灰灰（同时也是现在的TTG站长）创建，其早期成员也多半来自 KiSS，初期的WiKi多加挂滤镜。在Jaychu128加盟后改向原盘画质靠拢，WiKi组的作品以720P多见，比较经典的则会压制1080P，转 移至TTG后基本上新出的原盘会同时出720P、1080P。 10年中WiKi多位老组员退役，作品发布一度由动帝（dong1010）独力支撑，现在的 WiKi组内新人较多，故在国外认同度较低（很多老外更注重Encoder而非Group）但作品的品质一直保持着非常高的水准。NGB内部有专设的韩剧组和日剧组，分别由baby和kudo担任组长，以前NGB一般对外只发布其压制后的720P，现在也经常会将其1080i的片源流出来。 CHD、CHDTVCHD 压制组制作的重编码1080P/720P/480P不仅仅在国内，在全球也有很大的影响力，近一年时间里，CHD多次全球首发众多大片，其作品在国内外都 有着很广的流传度，组内CHP压制的1080P更是众多高清发烧友收藏的首选。CHDTV则经常放出自己录制的1080i。 HDChina、HDCTV（主页君注：现更名为HDW、HDWTV）现HDChina由原来的SiHD和HDChina合组而成，近段时间在新片的发布上非常迅速，在国内外依托着HDC的声望也得到了很多高清用户的认同，由于HDC有了单纯的KiSHD韩剧发布组，HDCTV主要以国产剧集、电影为主。 HDS、MySilu最早的以思路论坛为主站的思路团队分裂后，SiLU小组解体，自行成立HDS和MySilu两个组，并分别在两家思路论坛及后来的HDS、HDR发布。MySilu全球首创remux技术，但两家的压制作品在其他站点的流传度都不是很高 beAst、HDSTVbeAst是由HDS黄教授的粉丝群成员发起成立的，近一年来发展迅速，依托着HDS的独家片源首发了很多资源，HDSTV为HDS新建的HDTV小组 YYets、JDPT*两个录制组主要是录制日剧为主，JDPT现在驻守在G.因为明文禁止转载，自家又极少压制720P，因此流传度也不是很广，且由于日本对盗版的严厉打击，经常出现一季日剧烂尾的情况。

根据命名，可以知道资源的来源，从而判断资源画质的好坏。 1.CAM(枪版)——珍爱生命，远离枪版CAM通常是用数码摄像机从电影院盗录。有时会使用小三角架，但大多数时候不可能使用，所以摄像机会抖动。因此我们看到画面通常偏暗、人物常常会失真，视频画面时常会出现倾斜、抖动。 由于声音是电影院现场录制，所以经常会录到观众的笑声等杂音。因为这些因素，图象、声音质量通常都很差。 举例说明：Journey.To.The.Center.Of.The.Earth.CAM.XViD-CAMERA(地心游记3D枪版)","text":"一、资源片源解析 根据命名，可以知道资源的来源，从而判断资源画质的好坏。 1.CAM(枪版)——珍爱生命，远离枪版CAM通常是用数码摄像机从电影院盗录。有时会使用小三角架，但大多数时候不可能使用，所以摄像机会抖动。因此我们看到画面通常偏暗、人物常常会失真，视频画面时常会出现倾斜、抖动。 由于声音是电影院现场录制，所以经常会录到观众的笑声等杂音。因为这些因素，图象、声音质量通常都很差。 举例说明：Journey.To.The.Center.Of.The.Earth.CAM.XViD-CAMERA(地心游记3D枪版) 2.TS——只比枪版好一点TS与CAM版的标准是相同的。 但它使用的是外置音源(一般是影院座椅上为听力不好的人设的耳机孔)，这个音源不能保证是好的音源，因为受到很多背景噪音的干扰。TS是在空的影院或是用专业摄像机在投影室录制，所以图象质量可能比CAM好。但画面的起伏很大。常出现的有一般TS版和经过修复清晰TS版。 举例说明：Iron.Man.PROPER.TS.XviD-iLG(钢铁侠TS版) 3.TC——基本也可以忽略TC使用电视电影机从胶片直接数字拷贝。画面质量还不错,但亮度不足，有些昏暗。很多时候制作TC使用的音源来自TS，因此音质很差，但画面质量远好过TS。如果不是太讲究的话TC版还是不错的选择。 现在还有一种资源，含有：HC。用的很乱，可作当作是把Cam、TC、或DVDScr片源的分辨率拉伸到720p，无实质意义，画质依旧差，噱头而已。 举例说明：Madagascar.2005.TC.XviD.AC3.avi(马达加斯加TC版) *上面3种片源，有时也习惯统称为“枪版”，因为画面、声音质量都很差…… 4.R5——心急的您可以看这个DVD联盟为保护知识产权，将全世界依地理区域分为1-6区，若与影碟机的区域码不符，则可能无法播放。当然网上盗版都是经过破解，压制成.mkv、.avi格式后再分享的。 5区R5一般大都是俄罗斯5区版，由于北美大片在俄罗斯发行的语种经常配音为俄罗斯语，因此网络上会出现采用R5的视频+枪版TS的英语原声音频=合成版本(所以音效差)，有时俄版也会有英语音频，视情况而定了。但是，R5版不只是音效差，绝大部分情况视频质量也比欧美版DVD也差。R5区的DVD发布一般较欧美版早。 现在蓝光普及，DVD已很少见，以上说的情况在蓝光也适用，BluRay在全球也分区发售，有些电影俄版也较美版发行早。 举例说明：Get.Smart.R5.LINE.XViD-mVs.avi(糊涂侦探R5版) 5.DVDScr——最差也要看这个预览版的或者是测试版的DVD，非正式出版的版本。从预览版 DVD 中获取。比DVDRip早发布，但画质稍差。(经常有一些不在黑边里在屏幕下方滚动的消息，包含版权和反盗版电话号码 ，会影响观看。)。在欧美年末颁奖季时，给评委送审的片子可能就是这种片源（毕竟片子还没发售，防止泄露不可能给评委看高清版），也难为那些评委了。如果没有严格的划分它的画质应与TC版差不多。 举例说明：Quantum.of.Solace.REPACK.DVDScr.XviD-COALiTiON.avi(007大破量子危机DVDSCR版) 6.DVDRip——比较理想的版本DVDRIP是从最终版的DVD转制。质量应该是最好的。将DVD的视频、音频、字幕剥离出来，再经过压缩或者其他处理，然后重新合成成多媒体文件。一般来说，DVDrip由影音文件(后缀为avi)和字幕文件组成。 举例说明：Pineapple.Express.2008.DVDRip.XviD-ARROW.avi(菠萝快车DVDRip版) 7.HR-HDTV——不错的选择HR-HDTV准确名字叫做Half Resolution High Definition Television=HRHD（HR or HR-HDTV），也就是大家所说的全高清的一半，所以HR-HDTV也叫半高清。 这个概念被提出来后，主要随着人人影视（YYTs）的壮大而推广，被大家拟熟知。YYeTs人人影视在07年3月份的时候开始制定电影的HR-HDTV标准，并且做了很多实验电影发布，取得相当的好评，于是经过2008年10月最终修改后得到现在的HR-HDTV的固定标准。 HR-HDTV是用DivX/XviD/x264等MPEG4压缩技术对HDTV的视频图像进行高质量压缩,然后将视频、音频部分封装成一个.avi或.mkv文件，最后再加上外挂的字幕文件而形成的视频格式。 这里补充下，以前HR-HDTV多用HDTV的源，现在蓝光普及、获取也方便，多用蓝光片源，画质更优。但你看到下面的命名，你能知道是用的蓝光片源、还是HDTV片源，或WEB-DL片源吗？所以人人影视的资源有点“鱼龙混杂”，没有清晰的标注片源。 举例说明：Puss.In.Boots.2011.穿靴子的猫.双语字幕.HR-HDTV.AC3.1024X576.x264-YYTs *主页君对国内那些标清、高清、全高清、超高清、致清等概念，没关注过，也没兴趣，搞这些名堂有用吗？下面贴出这些概念的与720p/1080p等关系对应： 标清—SD—480P—720x480分辨率。高清—HD—720P—1280×720分辨率。全高清—FHD—1080P—1920x1080分辨率。俗称—2K—2048×1080分辨率。超清—UHD(Ultra HD)—4K—3840×2160或4096×2160分辨率。未来超高精细影像系统—SHV—8K—7680x4320分辨率（首部8K电影是日本NHK于2013嘎纳展映的短片《Beauties À La Carte（珍馐美味）》）。HDTV—高清电视缩写，涵盖720P/1080I/1080P。它其实不是分辨率，而是得到资源的方式，通常由用户通过采集设备/软件实时截取媒体流得到。HR-HDTV—半高清，分辨率约为960x540，是1080P的一半。人人影视在制定标准和推动普及中起到重要作用。所以，国内不管是优酷、腾讯等在线流媒体，还是XX天堂等资源站，无不在混淆视听，乱用标清、高清、全高清等概念。尤其是优酷等这样有影响力的媒体，为了吸引眼球，还混淆概念、曲解其意，给广大网友造成误解，真是害人不浅。 *提到人人影视，再说下，人人影视还喜欢发布rmvb格式的资源，rmvb格式早该淘汰了（后面讲格式再细说）。跟HR-HDTV概念一样，如今都高清时代，一个2008年制定的视频标准不改进摆了，还抱残守缺，坚持至今。不过，话又说回来，HR-HDTV的小体积、相对较高画质，对于中国的网络状况来说，也是一个较好的选择。不用花太多时间下载，又能享受到高质量影片。 8.TVRIP——TV转制所谓TVRip是从电视（数码有线电视/卫星电视捕捉等）转制的电视剧及接收卫星接收到的节目，然后通过电视卡进行捕捉，压缩成文件，我们看的很多综艺及体育节目都是TVRip。有些电视剧也会使用TVRip的方式进行发布。这类视频质量主要视电视台的画质质量而定，普通有线电影画质一般、高清有线电影画质就好了。 现在高清数字电视普及很快，一般都是HDTVRip，TVRip已很少见。 9.HDTVRipHDTVRip是高清片源（高清电视录制、高清卫星星号接收）转压，凡是高清电视片源转压的视频也都可以标为HDTVRip。 一般多见于电视剧，尤其是美剧。都是录制的高清有线电视，然后再压制。 举例说明：Boardwalk.Empire.S05E01.720p.HDTV.x264-KILLERS （大西洋帝国，美剧） 举例说明：Hail.the.Judge.1994.HDTV.x264.AAC-iHD （九品芝麻官之白面包青天，电影） 10.HDRIPHDRIP=HDTVRip ？ 主页君私认为，现在HDRip命名有点乱用，觉得多类似于HDTVRip(高清电视录制)、或Web-DL Rip（网络在线视频）。也没有统一的规范，资源怎么命名，也是资源压制者自己的事！！所以，资源命名难免有时会显得乱，看到命名后，分不清来源、不能确定画质质量如何。不过一般用HDRip，而不用HDTVRip命名的资源，前者比后者的画质质量差些。 举例说明：Age.of.the.Rampant.2014.720p.HDRip.H264.AAC-CJCONTENTS （群盗） 11、HD-DVDHD DVD（或称：High Definition DVD）是一种数字光储存格式的蓝色光束光碟产品。 HD DVD与其竞争对手蓝光光碟（Blu-ray Disc）相似，盘片均是和CD同样大小（直径为120毫米）的光学数字储存媒介，使用405纳米波长的蓝光。但在2008年，随着原先支持HD DVD的华纳公司宣布脱离HD DVD，以及美国数家连锁卖场决定支持蓝光产品，东芝公司终于在2008年2月19日正式宣布将终止HD DVD事业，这场持续了数年的规格之争，最终以蓝光的胜利而告终。所以，HD-DVD已成历史名词，目前网上流传带有HDDVD的片源，基本是2009年以前发行的。 举例说明：Seabiscuit.2003.720p.HDDVD.x264-ESiR（奔腾年代） 12.WEB-DL——仅次于蓝光的画质随着互联网的发展，这2、3年来，这种片源十分抢眼，经常在蓝光高清未出前，就流传于网上。且画质很好，一般能满足广大高清爱好者观众的需求。 顾名思义，Web-DL，即Web-Download，从网络上下载的。片源是一般是网络上线视频，如美国苹果的itunes，画质是最好，接近蓝光720p；国内的迅雷、优酷、腾讯、乐视等，也有在线付费视频，但画质就太差了！！ 按分辨率还有1080P.Web-DL、720P.Web-DL、WEBRip（WEBRip画质一般较差）。 举例说明： The Frozen Ground.2013.1080p.WEB-DL.H264-Abjex (冻结之地) 1080P.Web-DL Star.Trek.Into.Darkness.2013.720p.WEB-DL.H264-HDWinG （星际迷航:暗黑无界）720P.Web-DL We’re.The.Millers.2013.WEBRiP.XViD-UNiQUE (冒牌家庭) 。 这种片源也多见于美剧，不过比HDTV片源稍晚，在线播放总要比电视播放晚的，也符合实际情况。画质比HDTV版略好。 举例说明：Under.the.Dome.S02E11.Black.Ice.1080p.WEB-DL.DD5.1.H.264-NTb （苍穹之下，美剧） 13.BDRIP——目前视频画质的顶峰BDRip = Blue-ray Disc Rip，即蓝光高清转制。用蓝光圆盘压制。但大部分压制小组把用蓝光720P、1080P作转压制的视频也叫BDRip，是有误的，应该叫BRRip，非BDRip，一字之差。 720p、1080p、Rumux等都属于BDRip范畴，但为了更好的介绍，下面分开再说。 举例说明：Awake.2007.BDRip.X264-TLF.mkv(夺命手术BDRip版) 14.720P720P是美国电影电视工程师协会(SMPTE)制定的最高等级高清数字电视的格式标准，分辨率为：1280×720。高清分辨率主要分为：1080P、1080I、720P(i是interlace,隔行的意思，p是Progressive,逐行的意思)。720P是一种在逐行扫描下达到1280×720的分辨率的显示格式。是数字电影成像技术和计算机技术的融合。这是高清视频的最低标准。 举例说明：Le.Fabuleux.Destin.d’Amlie.Poulain.2001.BluRay.720p.x264.DD51-TBmovie.mkv (天使爱美丽720P) 720p/1080p只是分辨率，所以HDTV、HD-DVD、WEB-DL，甚至DVD的片源都可以压制成720p/1080p。千万不要把720p/1080p与蓝光等同起来，一提到720p/1080p就想到蓝光，这是误解。 15.1080P1080P是美国电影电视工程师协会(SMPTE)制定的最高等级高清数字电视的格式标准，有效显示格式为：1920×1080，像素数达到207.36万。 1080P带来的高画质给消费者带来的是真正的家庭影院的视听享受，由于它向下全面兼容其它高清格式，通用性非常强，保证了在未来十几年的时间里产品不会过时，具有很好的超前性。随着1080P片源的不断涌现，1080P产品的优势已经显现出来。 举例说明：Empire.State.2013.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x264-CHD(帝国，1080P版本) 16.REMUX——无损版Remux的意思是无损的提取出HD-DVD 或 BluRay里面的视频数据、音频数据，封装到我们熟悉的TS或者AVI格式文件中。 HD-DVDRip和BDRip（720p/1080p/BRRip）都是把原始的高清数据进行压缩、重编码，从1080P分辨率的视频压缩到720P分辨率或更低，40G、50左右的片子压缩到了4-10G左右，在低尺寸，如14、15、19寸的电脑上很难看出差别，但是上到大尺寸高分辩率的显示设备上，就能明显的看出区别了。所以，大屏幕、大宽带的朋友还是建议下载未重编码的Remux、或蓝光圆盘。 举例说明：The.Patriot.Extended.Cut.Blu-ray.REMUX.H264.1080P.DTS.LPCM.DD51.Fanxy@Silu.DISK1.ts (爱国者remux版本) 17、蓝光盘、DIY蓝光盘蓝光光盘，跟DVD光盘类似，有些电影发烧友会购买蓝光盘，然后破解（蓝光盘在全球分了几个区，例如中国的蓝光播放器，不能播放在美国购买的蓝光盘，属于版权保护），再在网上发布分享，继而有压制小组转压制（重编码）成720p/1080p等高清资源。蓝光光盘是原始片源，画质原汁原味，没有二次处理，所以很高清爱好发烧友会下载观看、或收藏蓝光原盘资源。目前蓝光原盘分享为1080p（1920*1080）为主，也有2K、4K等原盘。 举例说明：Star.Trek.Into.Darkness.2013.3D.BluRay.1080p.AVC.TrueHD.7.1-TTG （星际迷航：暗黑无界） 一般都40、50G，不是一般用户“消费”得起的。 DIY原盘，是对蓝光圆盘再加工，一般是对字幕、音频处理，不对视频处理。例如美国发布的蓝光盘，即使有人发到网上去了，由于控制菜单、字幕、视频都是英文，而非英语国家可能不方便观看，所以，出现了DIY原盘，对蓝光盘再加工，汉化菜单、添加中文字幕、中文音轨等。方便非英文网友观看、收藏！！ 举例说明：Oblivion 2013 1080p Blu-ray AVC DTS-HD MA 7.1-DiY-ego@HDWinG (遗落战境 DIY蓝光圆盘) 一般也都40、50G 18、4K——未来的高清发展方向之一4K视频也可以以蓝光作为存储载体，分辨率高达4096×2160，相应的细节、色彩、画面质量也更加高。一张4K的蓝光原盘不是大家所预想高达几百G，通常也只有几十G。 举例说明：Spider.Man.3.2007.4K.Mastered.Blu-ray.1080p.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.1.-BLUEBIRD 只有45.02GB，高分辨率不意味着大体积，这是大家最容易误解的。体积大小不与分辨率成正比，而与码率成正比。 用4K蓝光压制的720p/1080p，命名时一般会包括：4K、Remastered等字眼，或同时包括。 举例说明：Spider-Man.Trilogy.2002-2007.4K.Remastered.BluRay.1080p.x264.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-HDWinG *也许有人疑问，4K的片源转成成720p有什么意义？这里主页君个人的理解是，我们说4K画质好，不单是因为分辨率高了，而是细节、色彩等很多元素的配套提升，单单只提高分辨率不可能提升画质，比如一张几直Kb的图片，你可以人为用图片处理软件，拉伸成4K（4096×2160）的分辨率，但很显然，拉伸后，会显得模糊。 *同样的，相同分辨率也不意味着相同的画质，例如，iPhone 800相素 和小米800相素拍出来的图片，清晰度能一样吗？所以画质清晰度跟分辨率成正比的关系，要在一定条件也才能成立。 19、上面讲的资源的来源，再谈谈影片的来源：母盘：在电影拍摄完成后经过拍摄素材的剪辑拼接和后期制作，生成的正式影片最原始的版本，也是内容最完整细节最丰富的版本（体积极大，分辨率高）。受到时代和拍摄方式的影响（拓展阅读：基努李维斯策划的纪录片—阴阳相成 (豆瓣)），过去胶片时代使用的是母盘胶片，现在数码时代使用的是数字文件保存在存储介质中。随着现在技术的发展可以使用胶转数设备，通过数字修复的方式将胶片转换成数字格式保存（质量好的母版胶片转换后相当于4K-3840x2160分辨率）,这也是为什么现在我们可以买到一些老电影的蓝光碟（许多朋友观念中对老电影就不可能有高清版的认识是错误的）。母盘是用于制作影院电影拷贝和后期发行音像制品的模板，一旦保存发生意外后果不堪设想！这也是为什么许多老电影因原版胶片损坏或遗失无法修复，一些新电影因为母盘损坏耽搁上映。（拓展阅读：1.胶片修复热：拯救电影需要责任心和耐心 2.《白鹿原》母盘修复完毕近期上映）院线拷贝：属于专业放映领域。过去使用胶片拷贝放映，一个片子要被分成四五段拷贝（这也是为什么过去在影院看电影有时候会断一会儿的原因）。现在使用的是数字拷贝，单片体积大概是400-500G左右，存储于存储介质当中，配有播放密钥。目前院线使用的数字拷贝分辨率主要是2K-2048×1080分辨率，有些好的影院已经达到了4K-3840x2160分辨率。音像发行：民用播放领域。通常由发行公司通过碟片的形式实体发行，但近年随着网络的发展也采用数字渠道（iTunes,Amazon等）。实体碟片早期就是大家熟悉的VCD-352x240标准分辨率和DVD-960x540标准分辨率（DVD后期按容量又分为D9和D5，即9G和5G），现在主流的碟片就是下载电影时经常能看到的一个词—蓝光（BD）。（来自知乎：http://www.zhihu.com/question/20106926） 二、常见高清视频“扩展名”、视频标准1.AVI——廉颇老矣AVI英文全称为Audio Video Interleaved，即音频视频交错格式。是将语音和影像同步组合在一起的文件格式。它对视频文件采用了一种有损压缩方式，但压缩比较高，因此尽管面面质量不是太好，但其应用范围仍然非常广泛。(就目前来看，随着观众对电影品质要求的提升，，且Mkv格式的普及，AVI格式越来越力不从心了，新片基本很少有人压avi格式了)。 现在，AVI在DVD时代很普遍，但现在高清普及了，已经很少、很少有人会压制AVI格式的高清资源。 举例说明：Breaking.News.2004.DVDRip.XViD-TLF.avi(大事件avi格式版本) 2.MKV——当下主流MKV不是一种压缩格式，而是一种新的多媒体封装格式，也称多媒体容器 (Multimedia Container)。它可将多种不同编码的视频及16条以上不同格式的音频和不同语言的字幕流封装到一个Matroska Media文件当中。MKV最大的特点就是能容纳多种不同类型编码的视频、音频及字幕流。 MKV不同于DivX、XviD等视频编码格式，也不同于MP3、Ogg等音频编码格式。MKV只是为这些音、视频提供外壳的“组合”和“封装”格式。换句话说就是一种容器格式，常见的 AVl、VOB、MPEG、RM 格式其实也都属于这种类型。但它们要么结构陈旧，要么不够开放，这才促成了MKV这类新型多媒体封装格式的诞生。 举例说明：Children.Of.Man.2006.BDRE.1080p.x264.AC3-SiLUHD.mkv(人类之子MKV封装版本) 3.MOV——高清预告片首选它是Apple公司开发的一种音频、视频文件格式。QuickTime文件格式支持25位彩色，提供150多种视频效果，并配有提供了200多种MIDI兼容音响和设备的声音装置。它无论是在本地播放还是作为视频流格式在网上传播，都是一种优良的视频编码格式。QuickTime因具有跨平台、存储空间要求小等技术特点，得到业界的广泛认可。 现在MOV格式常常被用来制作高清电影预告片，可以达到1080P的所谓全高清标准。 举例说明：terminatorsalvation-tlr1_h1080p.mov(终结者4高清预告片) *主页君不太明白，为什么预告片发布都首选MOV格式，难道是因为在Mac电脑上编辑的缘故。 4.MP4——手机、平板的新宠儿有的电影是MP4格式的，这代表着它采用了MPEG-4视频压缩编码，但是具体是哪一种编码格式并不确定，一般来说是DIVX或者XVID。总之感觉是个很鸡肋的格式，一般是用在掌上便携设备上（IOS/安卓平台，如手机、平板），电脑用户不推荐。 举例说明：Friends.S01E01.The.One.Where.Monica.Gets.A.New.Roommate.iPod-mp4.chs-en.mp4(老友记第一季第一集，ipd专用版本，mp4格式) 5.TS——此TS非彼TS这个TS代表的是文件后缀名为.TS的高清格式。这种格式的优点在于对硬件的要求不高，即使是1080P的电影这两年的家用电脑都可以轻松播放，不过缺点同样明显——超大的文件体积，动辄三四十个G。 举例说明：Silent.Hill.Blu-ray.REMUX.MPEG2.1080P.LPCM.DTS.Orbitlee@Silu.ts(寂静岭TS版，9碟，完全大小37.9G，单碟4.3G) 6.RMVB——明日黄花RMVB由于很多年没有更新编码，再加上当初开发RMVB是为了做网络流媒体的，所以使用RMVB来压制高清是没有意义的，当RMVB码率达到1500KB以上就没有任何优势，甚至是出现劣势，因为算法关系，RMVB在处理细节和动态场景上是模糊的，无法展现细节，再加上他的音频是编码过的RA格式，严重丢失原声。 按理来说RMVB是早就应该淘汰的格式了，只有在中国这种特殊环境才得以生存。 7.XviD——常见标准###一种常见的视频编码标准。 最常用的MPEG-4视频压缩编码格式，我们下载的很多电影基于这种编码。 举例说明：Connected.2008.DVDRip.XviD-BiEN.avi(保持通话，xvid编码) 8.X264——业界先锋###一种常见的视频编码标准。 x264是一种免费的、具有更优秀算法的H.264/MPEG-4 AVC视频压缩编码格式。它同xvid一样都是开源项目，但x264是采用H.264标准的，而xvid是采用MPEG-4早期标准的。由于H.264是2003年正式发布的最新的视频编码标准，因此，在通常情况下，x264压缩出的视频文件在相同质量下要比xvid压缩出的文件要小，或者也可以说，在相同体积下比xvid压缩出的文件质量要好（*注：XviD、x264这点比较，摘自网上，不敢确定）。 举例说明：WALL.E.2008.BDRip.X264-TLF.mkv(机器人总动员，X264编码) 9、x265/HEVC——下一代视频编码标准###下一代视频编码标准。 x265是一个开源项目，是一个将视频编码为H.265/高效率的视频编码（HEVC）格式的免费的库。 现在普通的是x264（H.264）编码标准，H.265理论上会比H.264更节省空间，理论上能减小一半体积，但编码时间长点，所以压制小组在压制时要花更多时间。但存储体积减小一半，也是很有吸引力的。并且，X265编码的视频对播放器解码能力要求也高，推荐使用最新的Potpayer，其带的解码器能完美解码x265编码视频，否则会出现马赛克、很卡、黑屏等现象，国产播放器目前一般还不支持x265解码。 举例说明：Rise.of.the.Planet.of.the.Apes.2011.BluRay.1080p.DTS.x265-CHD（猩球崛起，7.36GB） 举例说明：Rise.of.the.Planet.of.the.Apes.2011.BluRay.REPACK.1080p.DTS.2Audio.x264-CHD（11.43 GB） 体积明显减小（没有减小一半是因为为保障画质，提高了码率）。等 所以，等技术成熟了，x265势必会成为下一代标准，更加节省存储空间。 10、8bit/10bit——下一代标准？###主流的视频都是8bit，10bit应用较少。 10bit压制是为了用更低的码率的同时保证更好的质量。这个术语太专业了，有兴趣可以百度8bit、10bit，不作过多介绍了，都是关于压制的专业知识，普通网友不需要搞懂这些，没意义。 需要说的，10bit与x265类似，都是在不降低画质的前提下，以求达到更小的体积。为了同一个目的，两种技术而已。 举例说明：Blind.Detective.2013.BluRay.1080p.x264-10bit.2Audio.AC3-HDTime（盲探 ，8.14GB） 三、常见高清资源中的音频标准## 音频标准中两家争夺比较厉害：杜比公司（Dolby Digital）和DTS公司(Digital Theatre System)。 以下介绍的音频标准，也是这两家同类型产品的竞争。 1.AC3——DTS的5.1声道###常见的电影音频格式。是DTS的。 杜比AC-3提供的环绕声系统由5个全频域声道和1个超低音声道组成，被称为5.1声道。5个声道包括左前、中央、右前、左后、右后。低音声道主要提供一些额外的低音信息，使一些场景，如爆炸、撞击等声音效果更好。 举例说明：Crank.2006.DVDRip.XviD.AC3-lsqh2002.avi(怒火攻心，音频格式AC3) 2.DD5.1——杜比的5.1声道###常见的电影音频格式。是的杜比。 5.1声道就是使用5个喇叭和1个超低音扬声器来达到一种身临其境感觉的音乐播放方式，由杜比公司开发。一般来讲，只有高清视频才采用这种音轨。 举例说明：Upside.Down.2012.Extended.Cut.720p.BluRay.DD5.1.x264-EbP *以介绍的是两家的5.1声道的音频标准，根据资源命名，还有可以遇到2.0、7.1声音。音频标准的水太深了，要太深厚的专业知识才能谈，主页君点到为止，有兴趣谷歌吧。 3.次世代音轨——下一代音频标准，未来的发展方向###人类的耳朵越来越会享受，音响设备越来越高端。 音频的发展是从声道数和码率上提高，从2.0声道发展到4.0、5.1、6.1、7.1……从kbps发展到Mbps、10Mbps……从有损压缩编码发展到无损压缩编码、无压缩编码……“次世代”音频就是无压缩编码。 次世代高清音轨，简单的说，是以下5种规格，LPCM（无损压缩）、杜比数字Plus（有损压缩）、杜比TRUEHD（无损压缩）、DTS-HD High resolution（有损压缩）、DTS-HD Master Audio（无损压缩）。这5种音轨，都是蓝光碟中新出现的音轨格式。普通音轨和次世代音轨相比就像256kbps码率的mp3和CD压缩的无损flac、ape相比一样，音质差距十分明显。 根据上面5种规格的命名，容易知道主要还是杜比、DTS两家的竞争，目前DTS处于上方。大部分蓝光原盘都使用的DTS“次世代”无损压缩。 因为一条次世代音轨少则1-2G，多则3-4G，太占地方了。所以，次世代音轨多在蓝光原盘、Remux、少量1080p资源中。720p及以下基本没有。 举例说明：Maleficent.2014.1080p.BluRay.REMUX.AVC.DTS-HD.MA7.1-RARBG （DTS的次世代音轨7.1声音） 四、电影资源的版本##1.REPACK——重新打包版###新片刚出时，有些电影压制小组，为了抢时间首发，难免乱中出错，导致视频压制错误，例如：压制视频时出些MSK（马赛克）、不能播放、失声等问题。所以，如果视频压制组织发布了一个坏的版本，他们会发布REPACK来解决这些问题。 增加Repack字眼，以区别上一版本，方便辨识。 举例说明：Divergent.2014.BluRay.Repack.720p.x264.DTS-HDWinG.mkv(歧者:异类觉醒，Repack版本) 2.PROPER——竞争的结果###Proper，英语解释，合适的，寓意更合适，说明发布的版本比前一版本更好。一般用户不要纠结于此，有电影看就可以了，电影收藏发烧友才需要关注。有时与Repack混用。 举例说明：Pirates.Of.The.Caribbean.At.Worlds.End.PROPER.DVDRip.XviD-HooKah-CD1.avi(加勒比海盗3世界尽头proper版本) 以上两种版本是由于压制小组导致的，与原片源无关。以下说的版本，与电影发行方有关、或与片源有关。 3.Director’s Cut——导演剪辑版###导演剪辑版，按导演拍摄电影的意愿剪辑的。因为影院上映的很多导演都没有优先剪辑权，要受投资方、制片人、市场等因素限制，不能按导演意思行事。 该版本主要用于碟片发行中，因为出于商业的、票房的原因，在影院上映的影片未必是导演最终剪辑后的版本。故而碟商们推出了所谓导演剪辑版，与影院版有所区别，也是为了满足一部分追求“原汁原味”的观众的要求，同时多了一条生财之道。 导演剪辑版与影院版，有的差别较大(无论是放映时间还是镜头)，有的则差别不大，因人因片而异。至于艺术成就，更是很难笼统而言。因为有人看重导演的主动权，但导演剪辑版也可能不如影院版更精炼，见仁见智而已。 举例说明：Saw.Director’s.Cut.HD.DVD.REMUX.VC1.1080p.DTS-HD.Silu.ts(电锯惊魂导演剪辑版) 4.Unrated/Theatrical.Cut——未分级版/剧场版（影院上映版本）###根据分级审查区分： 主要分为公映版和未分级版(Unrated）。MPAA(美国电影协会)根据电影的内容，会评定一个等级，如：R、NC-17、PG13、PG、G (越往后越小孩不宜)等。 有时为了照顾院线上映，适合上至成年人、下至儿童小孩，会对裸露、暴力、血腥、粗口等方面加以限制，删减某些片段。但是是在后面发行光盘时，限制就少了许多。加上未分级版（Unrated）字眼，也可以做为噱头宣传，增加发售量。 举例说明：Dawn.Of.The.Dead.UNRATED.Directors.Cut.2004.720p.BluRay.x264.AAC-iHD （活死人黎明，未分级导演剪辑版） 举例说明：Carrie.2013.2-in-1.Theatrical.&amp;.Extended.Cut.Blu-ray.CEE.1080p.AVC.DTS.5.1-HDCLUB（女嘉莉，剧场版/加长版2合1版本） 5.LIMITED——限制级版###LIMITED电影指该电影只在有限的电影院放映，通常少于250家。通常较小的电影(比如艺术电影)的发行是LIMETED。 举例说明：Frank.2014.LIMITED.720p.BluRay.x264-GECKOS (弗兰克limited版) 6. Extended——加长版###情形和导演剪辑版类似，很多的加长版是用来圈钱的,有的干脆就是把花絮里的删除段落直接加进去,也就长了几分钟而已。也有很厚道的,比如指环王的加长版,一部就加长了近50分钟,肯定对剧情有影响的。 举例说明：The.Lord.Of.The.Rings-Return.Of.The.King.EXTENDED.EDITION.DVDRip.XViD-ALLiANCE(指环王3，加长版) 7.IMAX——所谓巨幕###IMAX(即Image Maximum的缩写，意为“最大影像”)是一种能够放映比传统胶片更大和更高解像度的电影放映系统。 整套系统包括以IMAX规格摄制的影片拷贝、放映机、音响系统、银幕等。标准的IMAX银幕为22米宽、16米高，但完全可以在更大的银幕播放，而且迄今为止不断有更大的IMAX银幕出现。 许多热门大片有普通和IMAX两种版本。 举例说明：Star.Trek.Into.Darkness.2013.IMAX.1080p.BluRay.x264-WiKi（星迹迷航，IMAX版） 8、Anniversary.Edition——周年纪念版###某某周年纪念版。 举例说明：Dr.Strangelove.45th.Anniversary.Special.Edition.1964.1080p.US.Blu-ray.AVC.TrueHD 5.1-i6henl@TTG（奇爱博士，45周年纪念版） 9、CEE/EUR——中欧/欧版等###跟DVD光盘类似，蓝光光盘在全球也是分区的，某区的光盘不能在其他区的光驱上播放，或有次数限制 。 一般分为美版、CEE版（中欧版)、韩版、日版、港版、台港、中国大陆版等多个版本。 其中美版大多画质和音效的配备较高，当然也不是绝对、也有不少节目是各国版本画面、音效一致，不同版本主要是在字幕语言和多国语言音轨的配置方面。如阿凡 达就是各国版本音画一致。但美版大多没有中文字幕，而CEE中欧版则多会加入中文字幕，因此受到很多国内用户的喜爱。 港版、日版等也大多配置中文字幕，但多数是繁体中文字幕，中国大陆版一般会添加简体中文字幕及普通话国语音轨。区分这些不同国家的版本，主要还得从BD Info信息来看画面码率、音轨配置、及字幕语言等详细信息来判断那个版本更为适合。 现全球范围内发行的蓝光版本为： [大区]EUR,CEE,US,NODIC, [部分国家地区]UK,FRA,GRE,HK,TW,JPN,KR EUR：是指在整个欧洲范围发行，字幕以英语为主，包括欧洲其他国家的小种语言，但是近来在欧洲的亚洲移民较多，同时也考虑到向亚洲范围内发行，所以现在部分EUR版蓝光有了中文，韩文，日语等字幕。 CEE：是指中欧国家经济体，也就是包括了中欧以及东欧地区的小国家，这个地区发行的蓝光原盘中文字幕较多。 而且有时画质也比其他区的好，极具有收藏价值。US：是指美版蓝光，通常是在美国以及美洲地区首发，英语字幕为主，但为了照顾美洲其他国家，同时也有西班牙字幕，部分美版蓝光也有中，日，韩等字幕，因片而异。 NODIC：是指北欧地区，丹麦，挪威，冰岛等国家，这种版本的蓝光通常连英语字幕都没有，只有北欧国家的鸟语字幕，更不用说中文字幕了。很少见。 HK及TW：港版和台版，现在蓝光在香港以及台湾普遍的开始陆续发行，色戒，集结号等在港台上映的影片均发行了蓝光，欧美大片在港台发行已经有了相当数量，并面向东南亚地区发行，港台版本影片一般含有中文字幕（包括简体和繁体），卡通片以及纪录片带国语音轨也较多。 JPN,KR：日版和韩版。部分蓝光有中文字幕，甚至有国语音轨。因片而异。 UK,FRA,GRE：是指英国，法国，德国，这三个国家发行的蓝光均面向本土，故没有中文字幕，以英文字幕，法语字幕，德文字幕为主。举例说明：Snatch.2000.JPN.Blu-ray.1080p.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-TTG（偷拐抢骗，日版蓝光，含中英日等多国字幕） 举例说明：Puss.In.Boots.2011.HK.720p.BluRay.x264-WiKi (穿靴子的猫，香港版） 10、REMASTERED/4K——重新灌录版/4K版###Remastered主要用于CD，意为重新缩混的版本、重新灌录。 电影资源现在也引入这个词语，尤其是4K蓝光版是。许多老片蓝光修复、或4K蓝光修复、或某某周年纪念版时。 例如：Ghostbusters.II.1989.25th.Anniversary.Edition.Mastered.in.4K.Blu-ray.EUR.1080p.AVC.DTS-HD.MA.5.1-PCH（捉鬼敢死队2，25周年纪录版） 11、Open.Matte——满屏版###和普通版本的的区别在于：画面比例。 例如《泰坦尼克》最初的BD版是1998年公映版，1998年的泰坦尼克采用的是传统胶片拍摄，画面比例为2.35:1，之后的16:9版本是2012年重映版，2012年重映采用了IMAX修复技术，修改画面比例为1.78:1，前者画面大小相对后者较小，后者的画面更加大，同一个镜头下能够容下更多的内容。两者并没有片长或者片质上的区别。 举例说明：I.Robot.2004.Open.Matte.1080p.BluRay.x264.DTS-WiKi（机械公敌，满屏版），满屏版(1.78:1)、宽屏版(2.35:1) 注：视频编码方式/音频规格/封装方式等方面没有正式、统一的标准，不像其他行业，有政府或组织协会发布行业标准。这里没有标准，大家在这方面的见解、认识也是仁者见仁，智者见智。水很深，本文不可能完全正确，权作投砖引玉，高领悟人士可能会发现本文有纰漏，大家可以相互交流探讨。 五、通过NFO文件，查看压制参数##通过一部部影片标题，可以看出很多信息，如 The.Wolverine.2013.BluRay.720p.DTS.x264-OnlyHD （The.Wolverine.2013）：影片英文名称+出品年份（BluRay）：蓝光版，常见的还有BRRip/BDRip，HDrip，DVDRip，DVDscr(预售先行版），R5，TS/TC/CAM（枪版），WEB-DL（在线高清收费破解版），详见上述！720P，分辨率，一般的有720P、1080P、480p等。（x264）：格式视频编码，如若是MKV格式一般为x264编码（DTS）：音频格式，其外常见的还有AAC格式、mp3、Flac等。（OnlyHD ）：影片压制小组，不同组压制的风格和水平不同，影片质量也不同。我们在网上下到一部电影的时候，除了通过命名，还有什么方法了解资源的特性吗？答案是肯定的。我们下载资源，一般都包含如下三个文件：.mkv是正片，sample.mkv是样片（方便下一段验证资源的好坏）、.nfo是资源详细说明文件。如上图红框中所示的nfo文件，可以用记事本打开。如下：这里所指的资源，强调的是高清资源，或正规小组出的AVI,MKV格式的影片，非水印漫天飞的RMVB格式。另外，并不是高清格式区影片就一定比RMVB区的清晰，关键要看影片的版本、压制参数、码率、分辨率等等，在高清格式的影片都有具体的影片压制参数：视频编码、分辨率、帧、码率等，音频格式，比特率等，大家要学会看懂。更多这方面的信息，可以参考：NFO格式文件相关资料 这是举例，如： 12345678910111213Codec................: AC3 （音频格式）Bitrate..............: 448 Kbps （音频比特率）Channels.............: 6Language.............: English | Mandarin | Cantonese（音频语言：英语、普通话、粤语）Subtitles............: English | French| Japanese | Chinese （字幕:英语、法语、日语、中文）Encoded By...........: Reidy （视频重编码者的网络昵称）Codec ID.............: XViD （视频编码）Type.................: AVI （视频格式）Resolution...........:1280x544 （视频分辨率）Aspect Ratio.........:2.35:1 （画面比例）Q Frame..............: 0.120Bitrate..............: 2 997 Kbps （视频码率）Framerate............: 23.976 fps （帧） 所以，通过，阅读nfo文件，可以对资源的压制参数（字幕、音轨等），一目了然。 六、什么清晰画质，什么是质量好的资源##①rmvb、avi、mkv格式基本退出舞台，为什么mkv格式越为越流行？！###1、在体积相等的情况下，RMVB和MKV这两种格式哪个更清晰？####没可比性，MKV只是个封装方式，RMVB只是个编码格式，而且不可能体积一样。 因为mkv、avi、mp4等只是视频的封装格式，要分析那种视频更清晰的话，要看这些视频文件使用了什么视频编码。 如果真要比，推荐Mkv格式，rmvb为了达到体积小、清晰，使用模糊细节造成清晰的错觉，而mkv封装的电影更强调细节，视觉效果更好。 并且，rmvb格式的电影现在乱象丛生。现在，许多rmvb标注的神马高清BD，高清DVD，大多是吸引眼球，赢取点击而达到盈利的目的，广告水印亦是如此。一些网站为了广告，简单压制成rmvb，打上水印，就传到网上。而mkv压制电影的小组，相比来说专业点，虽然可能出于爱好，但更多是出于热爱！！ 另外，RMVB资源命名也不规范，没有上面介绍的那些专业命名术语，都是简单的中文名，好的还可能加上音轨、字幕等信息，简单粗暴，既不专业，也不能让网友了解压制参数。 2、一般电影观众下什么格式的电影、多大体积？一般1-2G左右大小，即BDRip、WEBRip、HDTVRip等，即可满足大众需要；再清晰画质的720P是最好了，4-6G左右，在有限网速下，最大满足视觉享受。 对电影发烧友，收藏者，首选1080P、720P。当然，再发烧，蓝光原盘、DIY蓝光原盘、Remux收藏的也是很不错的选择！！ ②同一部电影为什么同是720p，体积大小会相关很大呢？或者，同一部电影，720p为什么会比1080p大呢?上面也有写过的，720p/1080p只是分辨率，仅此而已，在其他条件没确定的情况下，不与体积大小成正比。一部视频大小只与码率成成比。 上面讲分辨率的时候说到，分辨率挺重要，但决定一段影片细节的最重要的还是码率。码率就是比特率，是指每秒传送的比特(bit)数。单位为 bps，比特率越高，单位时间内传送的数据量越大。码率和质量成正比，也与文件体积成正比。这就是为什么重编码视频体积大，蓝光原盘体积更大。蓝光原盘BD50码率在30Mbps左右，BD25在20-25Mbps左右，质量较好的1080P视频主流码率在10Mbps左右，720p码率在4-6Mbps左右。 码率对视频质量和体积影响真的很大，这也导致你下电影的时候会因发现同一个电影，出现文件体积：720P(低码率)＜1080P(低码率)＜720P(高码率)＜1080P(高码率) 的情况而百思不得其解。这种时候720P(高码率)的画质要好于1080P(低码率)，因为细节更为丰富。 一部电影体积大小=码率*片长，所以一部电影跟片长也有关系的。一般而言： 720p（低码率）1-4G左右、1080p（低码率）1-4G左右。 720p（高码率）4-8G左右、1080p（高码率）6-10G左右。 选择下载哪个片子就很明显了（一般推荐前3种）： 如果你空间充足追求品质你就下载原盘或者1080P(高码率)。 如果你空间不足但也在意细节，希望好点，就下720P(高码率)。 如果你空间不足又想看的差不多就下720P(低码率)。 如果你在乎分辨率又不是憋着看画面细节那种你就下1080P(低码率)。 详情可以看这篇文章：视频码率、帧率和分辨率到底哪一个影响电影的清晰度啊？ ③到哪里查询电影发售时间？为什么高清资源基本都没有中文字幕？怎么加载外挂字幕？###详情看这篇文章，这里不再赘述了。关于出片时间，下载速度，电影字幕的说明

For some streams in an unwritable location, DGIndexNV was crashing when the streamwas opened. Fixed. Modified DGDecodeNV to allow it to open compatible older DGI files, without generatingthe version mismatch popup. Fixed a problem that (rarely) caused DGIndexNV to hang at startup until an arrow keyis pressed. DGIndexNV adds a CLI option to specify the angle when opening an MPLS file from a bluray. Example: dgindexnv -i 00001.mpls -ang 0 If a valid angle is specified then the angle popup dialog is avoided. Fix for random failures of DGIndexNV to startup. Added a new auxiliary INI file option Force_Zoom. For example, if you want DGIndexNV to always usea zoom factor of 1/2, then set Force_Zoom to 2. Fixed bug in which the CLI progress report percentage could go backwards. Added a new CLI option -nc to disable automatic cropping for CLI invocation. For example, if you havea stream with height 1088 and you do not want it to be automatically cropped to 1080, include -nc onthe CLI invocation. Fixes crashes when an MKV file has more than 32 tracks. Improved handling when opening zero-length files (for both CLI and GUI). Fixed a bug that could cause a GOP back operation in DGIndexNV to fail. Added GTX 1070 and GTX 1080 to the GPUs database. Rebuilt DGDecodeNV for Avisynth 2.6 compatibility. Avisynth 2.5 is no longer supported.

惯例总结一下德国资源的特点。一、网盘下载方式主导二、独立电影盛行三、论坛形式广泛四、usent下载方式普遍 一、德国人做事情很严谨，也很周全，所以连网盘设计这个地方都能彰显魅力。一般的国外网盘免费下载方式基本都以输入验证码及读秒的方式完成，但是德国人做网盘，会出现许多新花样，需要度过层层关卡才会达到最终下载章节，虽然这种方式增加了下载的繁琐程度，但却也让喜欢探索的人有了新的乐趣。德国人网盘下载与其他国家不同，并不善用idm，而是更喜欢使用jdownloader，jd有利有弊，可以自行抓取媒体流及探索压缩包密码，但有时候下载容易中断且不能续连，所以一般网络不稳定的朋友并不建议使用。 二、德国人血脉中有比较野性的一面，特别是喜好极端艺术，尤以血腥暴力为主，不论是电影还是音乐，德国都存在着对哥特式死亡的崇尚，这在全欧洲来说也是别具一格的。单从电影来说，大部分独立血浆影片来自德国，其拍摄水准也达到了同行业至高点，成为了重口迷的津津乐道之处。不过虽然德国独立影片在粉丝群中火爆，但在全世界范围内，依然属于小众，这也使其资源并不是唾手可得，增加了资源搜索的难度。 三、第三点也是主要讲的一点，德国电影大多以论坛形式传播，论坛则多以网盘及usent方式下载。德国的论坛非常多，比较著名的有nox、bloodsuckerz、boerse、mygully、3dl.tv、warez-world等等。德站的资源质量都比较不错，正规论坛站点很少出现渣画质的压制品，这也体现了德国人做事的认真。论坛是德国电影爱好者的主要活动区域，你不但可以在论坛里得到电影，还可以得到其他相关资源，而且可以很友好地与德国人聊天。德国电影的搜索方式也同样是可以使用谷歌关键词堆砌及图搜等相关方式完成，一些重要的ptbt站点也有很多德国影视资源，这个在前几篇就提到过，所以就不在复述。 四、之所以把usent放到最后来说是因为usnet在国内还不够普遍，但是在德国是比较盛行的。usenet又称”新闻组”(newsgroups)，是一个全球性的文件交换网络，主要是付费的形式，当然，通过一些操作也可以实现免费的试用过程。这里有一个关于usent使用很好的教程，来自阮一峰的个人网站，在此借用并表示非常感谢。大家有时间可以参考一下。http://www.ruanyifeng.com/docs/usenet/ 以上便是对德国资源的一些介绍，资源搜索系列还会写下去，下一篇应该是法国篇或者意大利篇，也会对我个人对于不同国家资源及站点的一些理解看法，希望大家可以继续支持下去。","categories":[{"name":"电影","slug":"电影","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/categories/%E7%94%B5%E5%BD%B1/"}],"tags":[{"name":"搜索技术","slug":"搜索技术","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/tags/%E6%90%9C%E7%B4%A2%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF/"}]},{"title":"我的团长我的团.1080p.WEB-DL.[百度网盘]","slug":"18","date":"2016-06-02T09:06:00.000Z","updated":"2019-02-22T15:52:50.000Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/06/02/18/","link":"","permalink":"https://www.bfdz.ink/2016/06/02/18/","excerpt":"目前画质最好的版本

西，可以利用缅甸、泰国、印度，借助孟加拉湾到印度洋。于是，滇缅公路、滇越铁路…60年前从红土高原延伸出了这样一条条抗战生命线，它们构筑了高原新的 脊梁。中国军民如何前仆后继地浴血奋战消灭日寇保卫抗战生命线的真实历史故事，便成为了《我的团长，我的团》的整个故事背景和立意所在。 在一个离中缅边境不远叫作禅达的地方，一群来自五湖四海、不同出身不同身份甚至是不同政见的溃兵和百姓，因为种种命运际遇的原因而相会于此：北平人孟 烦了、军医郝兽医、湖南兵不辣、上海军官阿译、东北佬迷龙、豆饼、要麻、蛇屁股、康丫、川妹子小醉……战争的苦难和身体的伤病让他们过着绝望的日子，他们 互相厌憎又相依为命，不饿死不病死成为他们每天生存的最高目标。为了在严酷的战争环境下生存下来，别无选择的他们不得不摒弃前仇、恩怨、偏见、狭隘而团结 一致组成一支小分队，在现实的困境中他们认识到了民族存亡的大义，于是义无返顾共同投入到打击日本侵略者、保卫家园、捍卫尊严、为抗战胜利不惜付出生命代 价的正义斗争中，用血肉之躯书写一曲曲铁血卫国的悲壮战歌！ 一场战役过后小分队死伤惨重，硝烟弥漫中突然闯进一人，这个用诡计杀死了在仓库外封杀的五个日本兵的诡异男人自称是川军团副团长龙文章！回到禅达，龙 文章被宪兵逮捕，原来他不是什么团长，只是一个在团副死后摘了团副军衔给自己挂上的中尉。其他人被关在收容站，就在众人揣测身世极端坎坷的龙文章已经被枪 毙之际，传来新师长虞啸卿正式任命龙文章为团长的消息…… 在和日军凭怒江对峙的时刻，绝地求生的他们邂逅了一个有红色倾向的学生，龙文章和他相见恨晚，在理想与灵魂的辩论中面红耳赤…最后龙文章意味深长地说：我们太老，他们太年青…… 不久，龙文章拉出一支十三人突击队从红色学生说过的一处没被日军监控的湾流通过怒江去铜钹救回孟烦了的双亲。日占区的疮痍让众人觉得满心罪过，而龙文 章把他所谓的搭救变成了一场渡江侦察，期间邂逅了一支共产党游击队，曾经和龙文章辩论的红色学生已经是共产党员……突击队成功撤回东岸，共产党游击队为了 不让日军发现那条过江通道而全军覆没…… 虞啸卿正在准备一场大规模的渡江攻势，打算拿下已成心腹之患的南天门，一年多来日军已经把整座山改造成了庞大的堡垒，而以炮灰团从江那边得来的经验， 这样的攻势一定是必败。龙文章力止，虞啸卿给他半个月时间去寻找放弃攻击的证据。龙文章和孟烦了被迫出没西岸，在日军眼皮底下绘制南天门工事图。在龙文章 收集不可攻击的证据时，同样找到了攻下南天门的方法，但他无法说出“那个极其惨烈的方法”，因为他爱惜这个被戏称为炮灰团的每个人的性命，他心里清楚， “那个极其惨烈的方法”将意味着什么…… 这是一场战争，一场从此将炮灰团深深烙在历史长轴上的惊天地、泣鬼神的死亡之战…… 《我的团长，我的团》是一部主旋律题材作品，它从一 个独特的视角展现了中国各地军民联合起来共同抗击日本侵略者、承受战争苦难的历史全景图，突出了中国军民的民族大义和豪迈正气，其惨烈残酷、其艰苦卓绝、 其无与伦比的历史真实度与深刻的历史存在感，将令每一个观看此剧的观众再一次地成为这段历史的亲历者与见证人…… 百度网盘链接

（一）版权大家都理解，在日本本土，可以说版权的限制要比其他我们熟知的国家都要严重。在日本网站中，你几乎不会找到任何一个资源分享的bt或者pt论坛，也不会找到一个专业分享的网盘站（av除外）。所以，在日本本土网站取源，那么几乎全部集中到了在线视频这一点上。这个我们后面会详细提到。 （二）网盘博客。这里所说的网盘博客，指的是一些国外爱好者或者少数国内爱好者在国外开办的博客站，收集一些日本电影，常常以pinku为分类，比如我们常见的非专业（未出现日文片名）的wip，rl，相对专业（出现日文片名）的j字头网盘博客（je，jd，jf等）。虽然博客资源并不庞大，但是对于稀缺的日影来说，这些已经很给力了。 （三）日影在国外的一些论坛站点还是有许多资源的，特别是一些pt大站，比如adc，at，kg，cg，ptp等等。一些bt站比如ru，（俄罗斯比较多），kickass，海盗湾等等，这里特别提出一点，在一些亚洲其他国家，同样有着日本电影的bt，ed2k或者网盘下载，但是大家用的较少，比如（韩国，越南，泰国，伊朗）所以需要掌握一些韩国的bt站在线站.越南的网盘论坛以及泰国或者伊朗的在线站，这一点是比较独特的，会用的人不多。在非日本本土搜集日影的方法，路子和其他国家电影搜索类似，唯一不同的就是需要将日文片名替换成英文或者其他国家文字片名，之后可以按照前面讲述的两国搜索方法进行搜索。 （四）终于到了在线视频，前面其实都是铺垫。真正要讲的东西在这里。日本的“类似博客”并不少。其列表也很多，都从属“無料映画”分类。也就是免费的在线影视。国内的为“邦画”，国外的为“洋画”，通常可以找到很大的列表。之后按照列表去取影就可以了，也有自带的搜索引擎。目前最著名的两个日影博客为mhometheater与nekomoe。 我想这里很多人都会说一个名字“FC2”。的确是这样，FC2可以说是日影资源的主力军，大部分稀有日影，都是在FC2上淘来的。FC2的利用方法很简单，可以直接搜索日文片名，之后找到视频地址，利用一些下载工具就可以实现。资源体积都不大，基本都在几百兆，所以下载起来非常方便，推荐使用FVD这款浏览器插件，方便好用。FC2分为两部分，一部分是正常电影，一部分是成人分区，而大家喜欢的pinku类型，常常就在成人分区里。 FC2有时候会被墙，有时候则不会，有些页面会，有些页面又不会，需要自己把握。另外有些FC2的影视需要会员等级才可以观看下载，所以大家可以适时办理一下。 2015年对于FC2来说可以是浩劫之年，因为随着盘踞在FC2的日本资源大神一个个被封杀，FC2的稀缺资源也随之流失，万幸的是，本人与朋友在2014年下载了大部分FC2的存在文件，这是唯一让人安慰的。 对于FC2我就不再多说了，因为大家都很了解，关键要讲述的，是非FC2的视频站点，也可以好好利用起来。 一般日影的集中站点有以下几个：1、FC22、youtube（翻墙） 3、dailymotion（翻墙） 4、nicovideo （翻墙）5、veoh（翻墙）6、gyao（日本ip） 7、pandora 8、pipii 9、xvideos（翻墙）10、0xdb 11、naver12、daum 13、google视频 14、vk以及其他俄罗斯在线站点 15、hulu日本（美国ip）16、B站 17、土豆 18、miomio 我想在这里，大家可能比较熟知的是FC2、youtube、dailymotion、B站。剩下的估计没有人知道完全了。所以在这里把这些视频站点为大家分享一下，其中FC2、nico、gyao、pipii、miomio都是日本本土的。pandora、naver、daum是韩国的，vk俄罗斯，B站、土豆中国，其他基本都是英文国家网站。这里列出的18个，其实只是一小部分，国外还有很多类似的影视在线站点，都有完整的日影作品，本人在搜索过程中遇到过很多，特别是一些成人网。虽然这些是个人比较常用的，但却远远不足，还需要大家去整理发现。其下载方法都比较类似，各种插件软件就可以解决。日影的搜索引擎也比较多，这里给大家推荐使用雅虎日本，只要在搜索引擎里输入日文片名或者关键字，就可以搜索到影视地址。 现在还有一类搜索方式是直接依靠国外软件，比较著名的是winny与share，（share是高级版winny）是一种数据传输软件，运用p2p的传输方式，但是有更加相对完整的保密性。具体使用方法网上已经有很多教程，因为内容相对较多，今后会单开篇章介绍，各位关注就好。 该讲的差不多了，以后想起什么再补充，这里提醒一下大家，由于日方的版权限制严格，所以很多在线视频并不长远，如果发现，需要及时下载保存，否则很可能就会被举报失效，到时候后悔莫及。以上这些都是仅仅从搜索角度讲的，很多日影大神都走的是海外购碟这条路，DMM，中古，亚马逊这些都是淘碟圣地。具体海淘方法以后会单开篇讲。相辅相成，就可以最终实现资源伟业。希望大家都努力探寻吧！

（一）与其他国家的种子下载方式不同，ed2k在西班牙占据主流的位置，我们可以使用常见的迅雷旋风或者电驴等进行下载，不过这里有一个问题，就是由于远在他国取源，所以其连接并不是很通畅（除非以前有人下载过，记录到了本国服务器上），一般只有通过离线的方式才能将其拖下，而且并不是100%，成功离线的可能只有50%左右，所以说西班牙的资源拖拽还是存在一定困难。而且每一个下载器对于西班牙ed2k的识别度不同，这就要求我们在下载的时候需要多种方式并存，比如拖拽西班牙ed2k的时候，迅雷完全没有速度，包括离线，但是电驴却可以收取到信号，所以需要进行多次尝试。 （二）网盘博客在西班牙是十分流行的，一般都是由一两个人开博，多的也会有四五个，然后会将类型分布好，长期更新。资源可谓十分充足，博客的下载方式以网盘为主，不过这里带一句，在此之前，博客大多都以三个经典的主流网盘为存储方式，他们分别是来自美德的megaupload，mediafire，RapidShare。同时我们也知道，此三盘也早已风光不在，megaupload被查封，转型成为mega，而之前存入megaupload的资源则全部失效。RapidShare与mediafire的命运也与之类似，资源大部分丧失，只有少部分幸存下来，所以不夸张的说，megaupload，RapidShare，mediafire这三家资源库的崩塌可谓是稀有资源界有史以来最大的浩劫。目前来看，西班牙博客的网盘存储散于各种网盘，例如mega，SpeedyShare，putlocker，4shared，iFolder，hotfile，gigasize等。 （三）老式经典资源在西班牙十分流行，可能这与西班牙语国家的怀旧情节以及热爱经典的心理有关，这里主要指那些黑白画面，特别是那种以绘画人物像形式来作为海报的影片。（例如“卡萨布兰卡”）。而且西班牙喜欢字幕制作，经常会将外文字幕翻译为西班牙文。并且有很多独立的字幕组。 （四）上面主要介绍了西班牙的资源概况，下面应该说一说具体的搜索方式，大致方法也是类似的，如果采用google的话，那么直接搜索影片的西班牙名称即可。至于西班牙语的名称，我们可以从以下途径得到，一是imdb，二是Wikipedia，三是西班牙“豆瓣”filmaffinity。imdb虽然不支持中文或者俄文等译名，但是还是支持西班牙，法文，德文等等的。西班牙的在线影视站点也很多，不过大部分都是转载其他影视站点的内容，比如youtube，vk等等，我们可以直接在google搜索películasonline就可以轻松的发现。不再细说。接下来简单介绍一下西班牙的论坛，西班牙的论坛资源量充足，分类明细。我们只需将其记录，当作工具直接来用即可。资源搜索也集中在此类论坛与第三条的博客之中，因为资源实在太多，所以不好列举，只说几个常用的，尖货exvagos，经典divxclasico，老式noirestyle，mini电影minifilms。西班牙的水很深，等待大家慢慢摸索发现。 好了，西班牙的介绍就到这里，因为一时想不起那么多，有什么遗漏的以后慢慢增补。资源为原创，转载请注明出处，谢谢。

（一）盗版大国，从侧面表达的意思就是其资源是相当丰富的，一些稀有影视资源均可在俄罗斯站点找到。 （二）双语混音指的就是俄站的电影一般都是在其原有音轨的基础上，再加上另一条俄配音轨，我们听上去就是两种语言在同时发声，而且配的还毫无水平，让人十分蛋疼，有些朋友会通过技术手段去除俄音轨，不过总体来说还是很麻烦。 （三）在线站点众多，成百上千毫不为过，其大多以vk为载体，成立各个影视站点。（就好比国内的多家网站以快播或百度影音为载体，虽然本质不同，但是形式上一样）不过同时存在一些其他类别影视载体，比如kinobanda，tfilm，viooz，sockr，filmix等（可以从播放器形式上加以区分）这些在线站点基本都可以在国内直接点击播放，不过缓冲速度不一。而且很多站点在在线的同时可以下载，而搜索这类影视的办法主要有两种。 1、google关键词堆砌。 一般俄罗斯影视站点的排列顺序是这样的（俄文名）（英文名）（смотреть фильм）（年份信息等）或者（Смотреть онлайн фильм）（俄文名） （英文名）（年份信息等）括号里的俄文基本都为在线观看的意思。那么这里会遇到一个问题，怎么才可以知道一部电影的俄文名？我想和我们一样，我们知道一部电影的英文名大部分是在豆瓣或者时光一类的网站上搜索中文名，之后就可在相关资料中发现英文名，其实俄罗斯也有“豆瓣”，而这个“豆瓣”，使用范围最广的，就是kinopoisk，俄文表达是：КиноПоиск。只要你在导航里搜索英文名，就可得到此部影片的相关俄文资料，俄名也自在其中，只需将其记录即可。 2、google海报图搜。 这里的方法其实很通用，不仅仅适用于俄罗斯站，可以适用绝大多数影视站点。但是为什么会在这里列出，因为俄罗斯在线站有个很显著的特点，就是在自己的播放的整体页面，一般都会有一张海报与之相对，这就大大提高了图搜俄站的概率，而且，通过经验可以得知，一但图搜海报出现了俄站字符，你就可以通过（俄文）（英文名）（俄文）这种排列方式来却是此站是否是俄在线站。还有如果图搜时候出现了播放视频并伴有俄字符，那么其基本就可以确定是俄在线了。不过这里有一点十分要注意：俄在线有一种欺骗站，这种网站并不可以播放，但是图搜的时候依然会出现播放界面，区别的方法就是：真正的俄在线站都是以影片某个画面作为截图视频，如果你看到的播放界面是一个“开场”，那么你就不必浪费时间去点击摸索了，避免了这个可以提高搜索效率。 （四）btpt及网盘或ed2k论坛，俄站的btpt及论坛的数量也数不胜数，论坛也大多数以种子下载为主，不过部分会出现网盘以及ed2k下载方式。bt比较著名的是rutracker，我想大家应该都知道，一个综合站，其实这种类型的综合站还有很多，比如rutor，凤凰fenixclub，tomi等等，不再一一列举。其在google的搜索方式也可以（俄文名）（torrent或者торрент）pt也都能理解，与bt类似，不过属于私密系，但由于俄bt的强大常常将pt掩没。俄在线的影视基本都可在btpt找到，而且格式更加多种，内容更加丰富。俄网盘或ed2k论坛在内容上与bt类似，只是下载方式不同，不过这里有一点要提，就是俄罗斯的童影控与艺术控很多，拥有众多的童影论坛，如endigo，nnm-club等，世界上的童影大神大多集中在俄罗斯。 （五）网盘博客，这个可以好好说一下，俄站的网盘博客了大多以童影，艺术，QS，恐怖为主题。例如最为著名的wip（本人就在为wip工作），其他著名的包括asiamorte，medik，tbt等，且下载网盘不一，这里说一个俄本土网盘rusfolder，速度极快，但是下载过程相对复杂，在raremovie论坛里我曾写过教程，这里就不再赘述。 补充：俄搜索引擎也有很多，这个大家可以自己寻找，这里只为大家介绍一个常用的potorentam或者yandex.ru/video/，一般就相当于我们的百度视频。 好了，关于俄罗斯的搜索介绍暂时介绍到这里，其实这里说的俄罗斯，并不是特指俄罗斯，而是泛指所有使用俄语的国家，如格鲁吉亚，内容上有很多不足，希望大家多多提出，以后会慢慢弥补。内容为原创手打，转载请注名出处。

曾经繁华的中国都市大同市，如今屹立在一堆废墟的旁边。这座城市不仅污染严重，还因其陈旧的基础设施和摇摇欲坠的经济前景而濒临瘫痪。但大同市长想要改变这一切，他大胆地宣布了一项试图重塑昔日的辉煌的新计划，要知道这座城市的文明已经有1600年了。 然而，伴随着这项计划的是非常高的成本。数以千计的房屋被推倒，50万居民（占大同市总人口的百分之三十）将在他的打理下被重新安置。这位市长成功与否，完全取决于他是否能让愤怒的工人群体以及越来越忐忑的统治精英冷静下来。纪录片《中国市长》惊人地捕捉到了一个男人，甚至是一个国家疯狂跳跃着进入一个越来越动荡的未来的过程。 BT种子

在中国南方的最大城市–广州的一所医院的急诊室，摄制组在这前后呆了十个月的时间，他们跟随着日夜在市区内奔走的120急救车，用镜头去遭遇各种各样的急诊故事。 中国早已经是世界第二大经济体，但政府还是不得不承认自己是一个人口众多的发展中国家。随着城市化和工业化进程的加快，中国社会保障体系的建设远远落后于经济发展速度的矛盾日益呈现。 在急诊室，表面上离奇、荒诞的故事一一在镜头前“上演”。一方面，我们看到很多不懂得爱惜自己生命的人，另一方面，我们也表现出对一个健全有效的医疗保障体系渴望。 两千多年前，中国的哲人孟子已经提出，理想的“大同”社会应该是“老吾老以及人之老，幼吾幼以及人之幼”。近年，中国政府大张其鼓倡导的“和谐”社会似乎就是来源于此。社会理想的状况应该是让每个人都能有尊严活着，然后有尊严地死去。 最后，我们要特别感谢那些允许我们拍摄普通的中国人，成片时我们没法一一再联系到他们，并征求得他们的同意。是他们的故事让我们更加了解我们生存的社会，本片也将承诺不进行任何商业运作。 在线观看 优酷 棉花（2013）◎片 名 棉花◎年 代 2013◎国 家 中国大陆◎类 别 纪录片◎语 言 汉语普通话◎豆瓣评分 7.5/10 from 279 users◎豆瓣链接

导演认识了两位“朋友”。他与他们之间的交往构成了这部片子。开始，他并没有一个明确的计划要制作一部纪录片，但随着时间的推移，他开始有目的和他们交“朋友”。“朋友”们奇迹般地允许导演进入他们的生活，他们吸毒也贩毒的生活。 纪录片的制作者和被拍者之间到底应该是一种什么样的关系，这部影片给出了它的解释。 百度云下载 链接：http://pan.baidu.com/s/1qW5Q1dy 密码：1p15

45公里，香港80公里。20世纪80年代初至今，来自台湾、香港的资本和中国内地的大量廉价劳动力使它从农业小镇迅速发展为一个劳动密集型的工业城镇。工厂里的工人是进城打工的农民，他们从中国内地最贫困地区来到广东的厚街镇。工厂附近的出租屋是农民们进入城市的第一个落脚点，也是他们远离故乡后在千里之处建起的另一个家。本片真实记录了这些在厚街打工农民鲜为人知的生活状况，它们成为中国城市化进程中不可忽视的重要组成部分。
